So t he main objective of this paper is to examine various forms of research paradigms with the library study attempting to link with English education. The description is tried to make clear by linking with examples of selected an issue. For this, the paper starts by introducing a research paradigm as the looking glass to the world. So it is the lens of the researcher through which the study is completed. It was found that positivism is based on objective reality which is most appropriate in nat ural science and post-positivism is the modification (of positivism ) as demands more interaction between the researcher and participants . On the other hand, interpretivism is to understand the issue from an insider's view and constructivism is aimed at social construction. Furthermore, criticalism is to improve the situation of the oppressed , and feminism is purposeful to empower females. Moreover, pragmatism is to g enerate context -based knowledge and post-modernism is to exp lore representational knowledge. In a sense, integralism is to integrate different paradigms within one single research. This paper a lso explores the components of the research where ontology is a study of reality, epistemology is the study of knowledge generation , and methodology is the process of doing the particular research. It implicitly reflects the axiology as the study of value systems. Overviewing the various shifts from traditional to relatively today's research , the specific issue s are selected in connection to English education and suggested to link them contextually.

Paradigms search for what is a reality in that particular issue, how knowledge can be created with the selected issue, what steps are necessary to follow to complete the research task , and what value should be taken into account. The main mechanisms of any research paradigm as mentioned in Killam (2013), are ontology: the study of the researcher's beliefs about the nature of reality, the epistemology: examines the relationship between knowledge and researcher during investigation, methodology: the study of discovering knowledge, and axiology: the study of value system. So, the components of a paradigm are: ontology (study of reality), epistemology (how knowledge can be created), and methodology (why, what, from where, when, and how data is collected and analyzed) and methods are the spec ific techniques and procedures used to collect and analyze data (Scotland, 2012). As the research paradigm is the overall looking -glass researcher, it is full of philosophical models to complete the research. Thus, the research paradigm is the philosophical outline of systematic carrying out research. It can be introduced under the term 'model for searching answers' to the research question. The research paradigm is the view of the whole task which sets the foundation for the whole activities to ho ld in the process of search. According to Willis, (2007, p.8), \"A paradigm is thus a comprehensive belief system, world view, or framework that guides research and practice in a field.\" So a research paradigm is the pattern, mo del, or overall philosophical process of investigation. Various Research Paradigms in English Education Different scho lars have explained various discussions o n paradigms from past to present as found in literature studies. Regarding this, Scotland (2012) illustrated scientific, interpretive, and critical as the major paradigms in educational research.

Various Research Paradigms in English Education Different scho lars have explained various discussions o n paradigms from past to present as found in literature studies. Regarding this, Scotland (2012) illustrated scientific, interpretive, and critical as the major paradigms in educational research. Similarly, Taylor (2014) described post -positivism, interpretivism, criticalism, and post -modernism as commonly used in cont emporary social science. To this point, Kumatongo and Muzata, (2021) explained positivism, post -positivism, interpritivism, constructivism, and pragmatism. Using elaborative terminologies T aylor et al. (2012) discussed positivist and post-positivist under 'single paradigm research.' Likewise , interpretive, pragmatism , and post-modernism are within the 'multiple research paradigms' and further they introduce an 'integral perspective in research '. Thus positivism, post- positivism, interpretivism, criticalism, feminism, post-modernism, and integralism are the most discussed paradigms in the literature on research issues related to social science specifically in English education. Although many theoretical explanations are found about the research paradigms, very few practical links are observed in the descriptions and in their implementation. So, theoretical justification in practice is a prerequisite. Then, only application is possible. Thus, illustrating various research paradigms from different sources and attempting to make a linkage between explanation and execution (to English language education) is the main objective of this paper. Methodology This is a descriptive research paper based on the secondary sources of library study . The main objective is to examine v arious paradigms in social science specifically with examp les from English education. After studying the various literatures, the interaction is done with those literatures. To make the concept clear, some examples are given from each of the paradigms with reference to English 22 | Research Paradigms in English Education: A Brief Overview Surkhet Multiple Campus, Research Management Cell (RMC) \u0003 \u0003 education. The philosophical components of each paradigm are also tried to include in th is paper. The conclusion is drawn from the discussion of collected secondary sources.

Findings and Discussion Positivism Positivism is based on the view of only one reality: objectivity and suitable to te st hypotheses or theories. The only reality that can be achieved by the application of reason and experiment . As Scotland (2012) has given the title 'scientific paradigm ' with the claim of mostly used in natural science research, and elaborated positivism synonymously within it . Positivism is therefore close to objectivism which argues that reality exists external to the researcher and must be investigated through a rigorous process of scientific inquiry. To explain this concept, Kumatongo and Muzata (2021, p.17) mention, \"knowledge is based on experience of senses and can be obtained by observation and experiment.\" Likewise, Henning, et al. (2004) as cited in Kumatongo and Muzata (2021, p.17), positivism can be the best-used method for science education researchers. To discuss posit ivism, Taylor et al. (2012) explained the term 'single paradigm research' which has objectivity and only one way of knowing the reality. On the basis of the above discussion , i t can be presented that the ontology of this research is (absolute) naïve realism: reality already exists in the world, the epistemology is objectivism : only one reality that should be discovered by observation, and methodology is experimental quantitative (Guba, 1994). For instance, 'Effectiveness of Guided Writing in Teaching Composition' can be a res earch issue to examine with positivism. To investigate this particular issue in English education, I can take the positivism paradigm because I want to experiment with making an assumption that guided writing is effective for developing writing skills. It will be experimented in two groups as mentioned by Taylor and Medina (2013) experimental (or treatment) and control groups which involves quantitative methodology . The test item will be used as the tool to prove the only one objective truth: there is effectiveness of guided writing in teaching c", "source": "21-29.pdf"}, {"id": 4, "text": "xperiment with making an assumption that guided writing is effective for developing writing skills. It will be experimented in two groups as mentioned by Taylor and Medina (2013) experimental (or treatment) and control groups which involves quantitative methodology . The test item will be used as the tool to prove the only one objective truth: there is effectiveness of guided writing in teaching composition . In this study, i t has no role of researcher to influence the result, the influence is dependent on cause (guided writing) and effect (composition writing). Post-positivism It is a modified scientific or positivis t method : process, and tools for the social science and follows the same principles but allows more interaction between the researcher and participants (Willis, 2007). The limitations of posi tivism are tried to be reduced by thinking further to understand causes that influence outcomes (Kumatongo & Muzata 2021). Post-positivism is a further improved paradigm to overcome the weakness of posit ivism, to produce objective and generalizable knowledge by quasi - experimental res earch that utilizes treatment. Broadly, Taylor and Medina (2011) mentioned both positivism and post -positivism under the common title 'traditional paradigm'. It can be explained that the ontology of this research is critical realism (Guba, 1994), the epistemology is modified dualist or objective , and the methodology is deductive with modified experimental. For instance, 'Effectiveness of Brainstorming in Teaching Paragraph Writing' can be a research issue to be investigated with the application of post- positivism. Dipendra Kumar Khatri | 23@. Surkhet Journal Vol. 2, Issue 1, July 2023, Print ISSN 2362-1230 \u0003 \u0003 To study this particular issue in English education, I can take the post -positivism paradigm because I want to find out the effectiveness of brainstorming techniques in teaching parag raph writing.

The added tools and techniques create more interaction and modification than positivism. Interpretivism Making meaning is the result of various factors. People use perception to interpret what their senses tell them (Al-saadi 2014). As Scotland (2012) wrote reality is not objective, it is subjective perception and interpretation. The ont ological position of interpretivism is multiple realism and knowledge is subjective which is based on real-world phenomena and experiences perceived by different individuals. Kivunja and Kuyini (2017) have discussed within the same heading of interpretivist and constructivist paradigms to generate context-based understanding of people's thoughts, beliefs, and values. The act of interpretation of other's meaning perspective is mentioned by Taylor et al. (2012) and kept under the term multiple research paradigm. Similarly, Taylor and Medina (2013) described under the 'relatively new and humanistic paradigm ' which aims to understand other cultures from the i nside, by 'standing in their shoes,' 'looking through their eyes' and feeling their pleasure, or pain. Regarding this, Dammak (2015) explains s ocial world should be studied in the natural world through the eyes of the participants, without the intervention of the researcher. It does not follow experimentation, it requires exploration. Interpretivist researchers believe in reality which is based on people's subjective experiment of the external world. There is no single correct route or particular method: knowledge and meaning are acts of interpretation (Kumatongo & Muzata). It is to interpret what the subject is thinking (Kivunja & Kuyini 2017). The theme is that interpretivism b elieves in subjectivity (Taylor & Medina, 2013). Reality and knowledge can be generated by making a close relationship with the participant because it is influenced by anthropology and methodology .

The theme is that interpretivism b elieves in subjectivity (Taylor & Medina, 2013). Reality and knowledge can be generated by making a close relationship with the participant because it is influenced by anthropology and methodology . The nature of the investigation as mentioned in Taylor and Medina (2013) , inductive with qualitative ethnography, grounded theory approach, narrative inquiry, phenomenology, and case study are the most commonly found. For instance, ' An Exploration of Bachelor Level Learners' Experiences in Paragraph Writing' c an be a research issue to carry out a study with an interpretive paradigm. To investigate this particular is sue in English education, I can take the interpretive paradigm because I want to explore the learners' views about paragraph writi ng from their perspectives. As Taylor, et al. (2012) discussed this paradigm aims to generate a context-based understanding of people's thoughts, beliefs, values, and associated social norms. I can explore the learners' experiences related to paragraph writing making a very close rapport with them and I can interpret issues from their eyes. Further, I can use a qualitative approach with in - depth interview guidelines (four Bachelor level fourth year English group lear ners from Surkhet Multiple C ampus), and focused group discussion (among six learners) w hich will be an interpretive paradigm alike the features as mentioned in Tubey et al. (2015). The reality that guides this research is pluralism which believes that there is no single reality: not only one way of learning paragraph writing, they experience multiple ways. The learners' multiple perspectives on learning paragraph writing can be 24 | Research Paradigms in English Education: A Brief Overview Surkhet Multiple Campus, Research Management Cell (RMC) \u0003 \u0003 explored by working very closely with them. And knowledge can be interpreted from their worldviews. My aim is neither to generalize the experiences nor emancipate the learning but to understand the situation and how they are learning to write paragraphs. As mentioned in various literature, the positivist seeks to generalize, the critical paradigm seek s to emancipate and the interpretive paradigm seeks to understand the situation with inductive methodology (Scotland, 2012).

As mentioned in various literature, the positivist seeks to generalize, the critical paradigm seek s to emancipate and the interpretive paradigm seeks to understand the situation with inductive methodology (Scotland, 2012). My lens is to understand how the selected learners are learning to develop a paragraph in English. Constructivism Knowledge cannot be generated in a vacuum, it is a social phenomenon which is socially constructed. Interpretivism and constructivism approaches argue that knowledge is produced by exploring and understanding (not discovering) the social wor ld of the people being studied in a particular context (Al- saadi 2014). So, in a sense, i nterpretivism is known as understanding the world, and constructivism is focused on changing the world. The belief is, learning occurs only when learners discover knowledge through the spirit of experimentation and action. It can be illustrated that the ontology of this research is co-constructed: local and specific realism (Guba, 19940), knowledge can be generated from subjective experiences and methodology is inductive , and approaches are as same with interpretivism (Kivunja & Kuyini 2017). For instance, ' Role of Cooperative Learning in Paragraph Writing' can be a research issue to investigate with the world view of constructivism. To solve the problem in this particular issue in English educ ation, I can take the constructivism paradigm because I want to explore the role of cooperative learning in paragraph writing. I will be based on the assumption that working in a team will help to develop writing skills. The knowledge will be constructed by working among the team. The interaction between an individual and one's environment makes one's perception of the world one lives in, and thus reality is socially constructed (Kumatongo & Muzata, 2021). Criticalism The worldview of this paradigm is that knowledge is both socially constructed and influenced by power relativisms from wit hin society, which reflects that historical realism. As mentioned in Scotland (2012), reality has been shaped by social, political, cultural, ethnic, and gender val ues. It is also called the transformative paradigm in Kivunja and Kuyini (2017), which focused on social justice issues and seeks to address the political, social , and econom", "source": "21-29.pdf"}, {"id": 8, "text": "ly constructed and influenced by power relativisms from wit hin society, which reflects that historical realism.

It is also called the transformative paradigm in Kivunja and Kuyini (2017), which focused on social justice issues and seeks to address the political, social , and economic inequalities in relation to social oppression, conflict, struggle, and power st ructures. So Criticalism is raising questions about traditions and searching for alternatives to solve existing problems. This, t he primary purpose of criticalism is to identify, contest, and help to resolve ' gross power imbalances in society (Taylor & Medina, 2011). A researcher's role is to do advocacy, a change agent, who argues for and leads the way towards a more equitable, fair, and sustainable society. Regarding teaching and learning issues with criticalism, i t is to transfo rm the classroom community through critical action research and support transformative professional practices. Taylor (2014) explains the aim of criticalism is social restructuring. It is making a difference as mentioned in Taylor et al. (2012), for bringing change in the predisposed concept of the oppressed in the society. It can be discussed that the ontology of the critical paradigm is virtual realism (Guba, 1994), shaped by social, political, ethnic, economic, and or gender Dipendra Kumar Khatri | 25@.

For instance, ' An Exploration of Baadi (an ethnic group in Nepal) Students Experiences in Classroom Learning' can be a research issue to explore with criticalism. To study this particular issue in English education, I can take criticalism paradigm because I want to explore the Baadi learners' experiences in the classroom, especially in English subject class. An in- depth interview can be used as a tool to collect data as critical rese archers have agenda of change and improve the lives and situations of the oppressed (Dammak, 2015).

So the aim should be to bring change to the situation and uneasiness faced by Baadi students in their learning environment. Feminism Feminism is related to women's empowerment. From the study of a number of literature, it can be explained that feminism is based on the spirit of criticalism to empower the oppressed (Dammak, 2015). Feminism focuses on injustices because of gender as they have historically developed and currently exist in our society. This paradigm aims to improve the situation of women , not only by doing research about them but also by involving them in research for further betterment. It can be illustrated that the ontology o f feminism paradigm research is virtual reali sm (Guba, 1994), shaped by gender values , the epistemology is subjective to seek knowledge about women's experiences, and the methodology is quantitative or qualitative, or both (Ropers-Huilman & Winters, 2011). For instance, ' An Exploration of Female English Head Teachers' Experiences in Managing School Administration' can be a research issue to explore with feminism. To carry out research on this particular issue in English education, I can take the feminism paradigm because I want to explore the female head teacher s' experiences in managing school administration. The objective of this study will not be only to find out the existing experiences of female head teacher s but to enhance their administrative ability . It can be explored quantitatively as well as qualitatively by using surveys and focused group discussions. The focus of feminist theory places gender at the center of its analysis and improves the situation that they faced in their life (Ropers-Huilman & Winters, 2011). So this paradigm looks at the issues from t he gender perspective and gears to emancipate the oppressed ones. Pragmatism The term pragmatism refers to particularit y or context sensitivity.

It is situation-specific and assumes that knowledge is constructed differently in a different context with reference to time, place, and situation. Pragmatists are pluralists in that they are inclined to one system of philosophy like positivists and interpretivists. It is termed as multi -strategy or pragmatic research to generate knowledge from the diverse purpose to solve problems. Although Rahl (2017) states that pragmatism is not affiliated with any system or philosophy, it can be inferred from this statement and other literature that the ontology of this research is pluralism: nonsingular reality (Kivunja & Kuyini, 2017) , and the ep istemology is problem oriented to find the weaknesses and to strengthen it by using mix method approach. As mentioned by Kumatongo and Muzata (2021) the use of mixed design is flexible in terms of 26 | Research Paradigms in English Education: A Brief Overview Surkhet Multiple Campus, Research Management Cell (RMC) \u0003 \u0003 methods, techniques, and procedures that pragmatism implements. For instance, ' Use of ICT in Teaching English during Pandemic in Karnali Province' can be a research iss ue to investigate with the view of pragmatism. To investigate this particular issue in English education, I can take the pragmatism because I want to find out the situation of using ICT in Karnali Province: a particular place, and during the pandemic time: a particular time. As in Kivunja and Kuyini (2017), pragmatism advocates relational epistemology which is appropriate to a particular study and specific time and place. The assumption is that the situation of ICT use may not be the same in all provinces of Nepal. Moreo ver, the use of ICT other than pandemic time, might be different. Post-modernism No human being can see what is going on in another's mind. The truth is not final but ch anging. Many factors play roles in reflecting reality, there are multi-layers in the meaning -making process. Factually, t here is no such window to see what is going on in someone's mind .

A person what he/she speaks or writes may not be the same in his/her mind. Taylor and Medina (2013) discussed post-modernism under the term 'relatively new paradigm' and explored the concept of 'representation,' the best we can do is represent our thought, and feelings through various means of communication such as language, art, dance, and gestures. Likewise, Taylor (2014) mentioned the 20th century witnessed the unfolding of a post - modern sensibility the linguistic (narrative) turn. It can be discussed that the ontology of this research is pluralism (Taylor et al., 2012), the epistemology is a transformative strategy to address global issues and the methodology is qualitative. For instance, ' The Study of Pictures and Symbols Painted on the Trucks ' can be a research issue to investigate with the post-modernism paradigm. To study this particular issue in English education, I can take the postmodernism paradigm because I want to explore the meaning of pictures and symbols which are painted on the trucks. The painted pictures and symbols on the trucks might give different meanings which can vary what it intends to enta il. As in Taylor and Medina (2013) a person what he/she speaks or writes may not be the same in his/her mind so the meaning may not be the same as shown by t he pictures and symbols on the t rucks. Those might have various meanings than those understood in day-to-day life. Integralism Integralism is the philosophy of bringing together more than one aspect in a single unit. So, integralism is eclectic in nature and integrates multiple paradigms in one research interdependent pluralism (Taylor et al. 2012). Likewise, it is to think holistically about the prospective contribution of multiple research paradigms from post-positivism to post-modernism (Taylor, 2014).

For instance, ' Knowledge and Practices of Novice Researchers in Writing Assignments Regarding the Use of Invention Techniques' can be a research issue to work with the integralism paradigm. To carry out research on this particular issue in English education, I can take integralism paradigm because I want to explore novice researchers ' knowledge and practices about invention techniques in writing assignments. It will be the bringing together of feminism and interpretivism where the use of feminism is purposeful to understand what females know about invention techniques and how they can be enhanced in their writing to develop . It will also integrate an interpretive paradigm to know their feelings about invention techniques and about writing assignments. Taylor and Medina (2013) suggest using a research design that combines two or other paradigms to make multi -paradigmatic research in this 21st century. Conclusion To conclude, the research paradigm is the researcher's looking glass to complete the investigation. As mentioned in Kivunja & Kuyini (2017), the research paradigm is the lens through which a researcher looks at the research world i.e. investigation issue . So, the paradigm is t he mental picture of the object of the research problem. Thus, it is the road map that leads the research purposefully.

Moreover, post-positivism further modifies positivism with more interaction and tools to solve the problems in social science. Likewise, Interpretivism and constructivism understand the situation and construct the reality respectively . Similarly, Criticalism and feminism empower the marginalized group and women respectively. Pragmatism intends to investigate and solve contextual problems. Furthermore, postmodernism makes the representative meaning of language, art, and other means of communication and integralism integrates different paradigms within one single research with abductive methodology. In short, the research paradigms are shifting not only with time but also to fulfill the purposes of the particular research issue. Today's researchers are arguing for multiple paradigms as Poni (2014) says the research community has been discussing the dilemmatic issue of mixing research paradigms from positivism to integralism.

Postgraduate ABSTRACT: The structure of the research processes is represented according to the paradigmatic nature of the researcher's knowledge and two major differentiation criteria: the DIACHRONIC Structure and the SYNCHRONOUS Structure. Every investigative process varies according to its evo lution over time for the first structure and how it is considered an independent process over time, according to the second structure (Padrón, 1992). Researchers throughout the history of science have developed, shared, and worked under a worldview of real ity that has led them to a system of beliefs around knowledge as ways of accessing and producing the knowledge that they come to be the different paradigms. This belief system has been very divergent from eac h other in different eras of science. Whether or not it coincides is determined by that paradigmatic vision, which in turn explains the techniques, procedures, types of samples, methods, and language used, among other things. KEYWORDS: structure of research processes, epistemological paradigms, nature of knowledge, types of research, research traditions INTRODUCTION Epistemological paradigms of knowledge refer to the fundamental approaches that govern how we understand, acquire and validate knowledge in different fields of knowledge. (Madriz, & Flora, 2012). These paradigms provide a conceptual and methodological framework for addressing questions and problems in research and the philosophy of science. (Soto, 2023) The Positivist Paradigm is based on the idea that knowledge is derived from empirical observation and experimentation. (Bourdeau, 2003) The Hermeneutic Paradigm is focused on the interpretation and understanding of texts and meanings. It has a focus on subjecti vity and deep understanding of human interpretations. It emphasizes the usefulness and applicability of knowledge. It is concerned with how knowledge is applied in practice and solves concrete problems.

(Bourdeau, 2003) The Hermeneutic Paradigm is focused on the interpretation and understanding of texts and meanings. It has a focus on subjecti vity and deep understanding of human interpretations. It emphasizes the usefulness and applicability of knowledge. It is concerned with how knowledge is applied in practice and solves concrete problems. (Espinosa, Agudelo, & Pachón, 2011) While the Critical Paradigm highlights the influence of power structures in the construction of knowledge. (Giraldo, Cruz, & Guarín, 2023) Examines the social and political dimensions of knowledge and seeks emancipation and social transformation. It maintain s that knowledge is constructed by individuals through interaction with their environment. It focus es on subjective perception and personal interpretation. (Molina, Molina, & Vanegas, 2021) The complexity paradigm is a conceptual and methodological approach used to understand phenomena and systems that are inherently complex and that cannot be fully exp lained or predicted using traditional analysis approaches. (Morin, (1994) This paradigm is based on the idea that the real world is full of dynamic, interconnected, and adaptive systems that exhibit emergent and nonlinear properties. These epistemological paradigms represent different ways of approaching the search and construction of knowledge. Each has its own philosophical and methodological premises that influence how knowledge is researched, interpreted, and validated in vario us disciplines and contexts. (Taeli Gómez, 2010). The diachronic vision of research defines four phases of these, which are called, respectively: descriptive, explanatory, con trastive and applicative. Which determine typical variations of the investigative processes and that inters ect with the four epistemological paradigms forming sixteen basic patterns for research. (Soto, 2016) Paradigms and Different Types of Research IJSSHR,Volume 06 Issue 12 December 2023 www.ijsshr.in Page 7443 The most basic level goes from the descriptive level to the application phase, which is the most complex level of depth.

The researcher, through the review of the literature and the background, determines the level of development achieved in his research topic (Soto Molina, 2016). The different paradigmatic visions and the different types of research 1. Positivist Paradigm: • Quantitative Research: In this approach, objectivity and precise measurement of phenomena are valued. Quantitative methods are used to collect numerical data and perform statistical analysis. • Experimental: Experimental research focuses on establishing causal relations hips through the manipulation of independent variables and the measurement of effects on dependent variables. • Surveys and Cohort Studies: Surveys and longitudinal studies are used to collect data from large groups of people and analyze trends and correla tions.• Correlational research: is a research approach that aims to explore and measure the relationship or association between two or more variables without directly intervening in them. In other words, the aim is to determine if there is a statistical relationship between the variables, but the aim is not to establish a causal relationship or manipulate any of the variables. • \"Ex post facto\" or fait accompli research is a research approach that is carried out after the events or phenomena have occur red, that is, it is carried out after the fact and does not involve interventions or direct manipulation of variables. The term \"ex post facto\" comes from Latin and means \"after the fact.\" This methodology is used to observe and analyze the relationships betwee n variables and events that have already taken place and cannot be controlled or altered by the researcher.

It is based on the collection and critical analysis of primary and secondary sources, such as documents, letters, d iaries, photographs, records, testimonies, and archaeological evidence, among others. 2. Interpretive Paradigm: • Qualitative Research: Focuses on the deep understanding of human experience and the interpretation of meanings. Qualitative methods are used, such as in-depth interviews, participant observation and content analysis. • Ethnography: Researchers immerse them selves in the culture or context they study to gain a more complete understanding of cultural practices and beliefs. • Case Studies: A case or a group of cases is thoroughly investigated to understand its uniqueness and context. • Grounded Theory research, also known as Grounded Theory in English, is a qualitative research approach that aims to develop theories or conceptual frameworks from data collected in the field. Unlike other approaches that may start with existing theo ries and test predefined hypothe ses, Grounded Theory focuses on generating inductive theories from information obtained during research. • Phenomenological research is a qualitative research approach that focuses on exploring and understanding individuals' subject ive experiences and perc eption of reality. This approach seeks to understand how people experience and make sense of various phenomena, events, or situations in their lives. Phenomenology is based on Husserl's phenomenological philosophy and has been applied in a variety of disciplines, including psychology, sociology, education, and nursing. • Biographical method or life story research is a qualitative research approach that focuses on the study and narration of the life of a person or a group of individuals.

This method seeks to understand in depth the lives of the participants, including their experiences, decisions, changes, and contexts over time. • Symbolic Interactionism research is a sociological and psychological approach that focuses on the study of social interaction and the construction of meanings in everyday life. This approach is based on the idea that people attribute meanings to symbols a nd gestures in their interactions with others, and that these meanings influence their behavior and the way they interpret the w orld around them. 3. Socio-Critical or Constructivist Paradigm: • Participatory Action Research (PAR): Researchers collaborate closely with research participants, and knowledge is constructed through action and reflection. • Artifact-Based Research: Focuses on the creation and analysis of cultural artifacts, such as documents, works of art or technological systems, to understand the social construction of knowledge. • Narrative Research: Personal stories and narratives are used to explore how people construct individual and collective meanings and realities. • Content Analysis research and Discourse Analysis are two qualitative research approaches used to analyze and understand the content of different types of written, oral or visual communication. These appr oaches allow us to systematically and structurally examine the meaning, patterns and trends present in texts, speeches, images or other types of content. • Ethnomethodological research is a sociological approach that focuses on the study of how people create and maintain social order in their everyday interactions. This approach is based on the idea that people use routines and unwritten rules to give meani ng and structure to their social actions and seeks to unravel these underlying rules through detailed observation of social interactions. 4.

Complexity or emerging paradigm The complexity paradigm or emergent paradigm is characterized by addressing phenomena that are inherently complex and difficult to reduce to simple components. In this approach, the int erconnection of multiple variables and the influence of contextual factors on the understanding of phenomena are recognized. Research traditions associated with this paradigm include: Complex Systems Research: This research tradition focuses on understandi ng systems that consist of numerous interconnected elements. Researchers analyze how system -level patterns and behaviors emerge from the interactions of its components. Computational models and simulation are common tools in this tradition. Network Theory: Focuses on the study of networks, such as social networks, information networks, or even biological and ecological networks. Researchers explore the structure of connections and how they influence information propagation or system dynamics. Systems Thinking: This tradition focuses on the analysis of complex systems and how changes in one component can have cascading effects throughout the system. It is used to address interdisciplinary problems and to better understand the interrelationships between different parts of a system. Paradigms and Different Types of Research IJSSHR,Volume 06 Issue 12 December 2023 www.ijsshr.in Page 7445 Interconnection: Recognizes that the elements of a complex system are interconnected and that the interactions between them a re fundamental to understanding its behavior. Emergent Properties: Complex systems can exhibit emergent prop erties, meaning that the characteristics of the system cannot be explained simply by analyzing its individual parts. Agent-Based Modeling: Researchers create models that represent individual agents interacting in an environment. This is used to simulate complex phenomena and observe how collective patterns and behaviors emerge from agent interactions. Transdisciplinary Research: Rather than focusing on individual disciplines, transdisciplinary research seeks to address compl ex problems through the collaboration of experts from various disciplines.

This is used to simulate complex phenomena and observe how collective patterns and behaviors emerge from agent interactions. Transdisciplinary Research: Rather than focusing on individual disciplines, transdisciplinary research seeks to address compl ex problems through the collaboration of experts from various disciplines. The goal is to develop comprehensive solutions that consider multiple perspectives and dimensions. Nonlinearity: Relationships within complex systems are often nonlinear, meaning that small changes can have disprop ortionate effects. Holistic approach: Focuses on a holistic understanding rather than a reductionist analysis of systems. Research in Change and Adaptation: In a constantly changing world, this tradition focuses on understanding how organizations, systems and societies adapt and evolve in response to complex and dynamic changes in their environment.In summary, the complexity or emergent paradigm is based on the idea that some phenomena are inherently complex and require research approaches that can capture and understand that complexity. The research traditions mentioned above are examples of how researchers approach problems from this perspective, recognizing the multiple interactions and dimensions involved in complex phenomena.It is important to note that these categories are simplifications and that, in practice, researchers can combine approaches and methods from different paradigms depending on their research objectives and the questions they wish to answer. Furthermore, in recent decades, there has been an increase in the adoption of interdisciplinary approaches that transcend traditional paradigm boundaries, which has enriched research in many areas. Here is a more detailed definition of each of the research traditions of each paradigm: 1. Positivist Paradigm in detail Correlational research is a type of scientific research that focuses on examining and quantifying the relationship between tw o or more variables. This relationship can be positive (when an increase in one variable is related to an increase in the other), negative (when an increase in one variable is related to a decrease in the other) or there is no obvious relationship. Researchers use statistical techniques to analyze data collected from samples or populations and determine the st rength and direction of correlation between variab", "source": "32.pdf"}, {"id": 23, "text": "iables. This relationship can be positive (when an increase in one variable is related to an increase in the other), negative (when an increase in one variable is related to a decrease in the other) or there is no obvious relationship. Researchers use statistical techniques to analyze data collected from samples or populations and determine the st rength and direction of correlation between variables of interest. Correlational research is valuable for identifying patterns, trends, or statistical relationships in data, but it does not establish causality or allow us to conclude that one variable dire ctly causes changes in the other. In summary, correlational research is useful for exploring and describing statistical relationships between variables, which can provide valuable information to understand associations in natural, social, or psychological phenomena, but it does not allow determining cause and effect between the variables studied. • Experimental research is a scientific research approach in which the researcher deliberately manipulates one or more independ ent variables (factors believed to c ause an effect) to observe their effect on a dependent variable (the outcome being studied). This approach is used to establish cause and effect relationships between variables and is one of the most powerful methodologies for investigating relationships between phenomena. Here is a more detailed definition: Experimental research is a scientific method that focuses on the controlled manipulation of one or more independent variables to examine their impact on a specific dependent variable. The experimental p rocess is carried out in a controlled environment to minimize the influence of confounding or unwanted variables, allowing researchers to attribute observed results to the variab les they are manipulating. Key elements of experimental research include: Manipulation of independent variables: Researchers make deliberate changes to one or more independent variables to see how they affect the dependent variable. Control group: A control group that is not subject to the manipulation of independent variables i s used to compare the results with the experimental group that is. This allows us to evaluate whether the independent variable caused a change in the dependent variable.

Control group: A control group that is not subject to the manipulation of independent variables i s used to compare the results with the experimental group that is. This allows us to evaluate whether the independent variable caused a change in the dependent variable. Randomization: Participants are randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups to ensure that the groups are comparable and to minimize bias. Control of confounding variables: An effort is made to control and keep constant all variables that are not being manipulated , so that they do not affect the results. Accurate measurement: D ata are collected accurately and systematically to measure the effects of manipulating independent variables on the dependent variable. Paradigms and Different Types of Research IJSSHR,Volume 06 Issue 12 December 2023 www.ijsshr.in Page 7446 Experimental research is especially useful for establishing cause -and-effect relationships because it allows researchers to control and manipulate study conditions. This approach is used in various disciplines, including psychology, biology, physics, and so cial sciences, to answer questions about how variables function and interact in a controlled environment. • Quasi-experimental research is a research approach that shares characteristics with both experimental research and non - experimental (observational) research. In quasi -experimental research, researchers manipulate an independent variable (as in experimental research) but do not have complete control over the assignment of subjects to study groups, which more closely resembles the design of non-experimental research. Here is a more detailed definition: Key features of quasi-experimental research: 1. Manipulation of independent variables: Researchers introduce deliberate changes in one or more independent variables to observe their effect on a specific dependent variable. 2. Comparison groups: Comparison groups are used, but assignment to these groups is not completely ra ndom, but is based on specific criteria or pre-existing characteristics of the subjects. 3. Control of confounding variables: An effort is made to control and hold constant other variables that may influence the re sults, although this may be more difficult to achieve than in traditional experimental research. 4. Lack of complete randomization: The", "source": "32.pdf"}, {"id": 25, "text": "t assignment to these groups is not completely ra ndom, but is based on specific criteria or pre-existing characteristics of the subjects. 3. Control of confounding variables: An effort is made to control and hold constant other variables that may influence the re sults, although this may be more difficult to achieve than in traditional experimental research. 4. Lack of complete randomization: The assignment of subjects to groups is not done in a complete random manner, which can introduce a certain degree of bias or limit the ability to establish cause and effect relationships with the same confidence as in pure experimental research. Quasi-experimental research is useful when it is unethical or practical to assign participants randomly or when study groups are formed based on pre-existing characteristics. Although it does not offer the same level of control as pure experimental research, it can provide valuable information about the relationships between variables in situations where full experimental manipulation is not feasible. • Historical research is a research approach that focuses on the study and understanding of the past through the critical and systematic examination of sources of historical information. Its main objective is to reconstruct and analyze events, processes, cultures, societies and changes over time. Here is a more detailed definition: Key features of historical research: 1. Gathering Evidence: Historians gather a wide range of sources of historical information to obtain a complete and accurate picture of the past. These sources can be written, visual, oral or material in nature. 2. Critical analysis: A critical and methodological approach is applied to the examination of sources to determine their authenticity, reliability and relevance to the research. 3. Contextualization: Historians seek to understand the context in which historical events and processes occurred, including social, political, cultural and economic factors. 4. Historical Narrative: Historical research involves narrating or constructing a coherent, evidence-based narrative that explains and describes historical events and developments. 5. Interpretation: Historians interpret data and sources to provide a deeper understanding of events and their implications. 6.

Interpretation: Historians interpret data and sources to provide a deeper understanding of events and their implications. 6. Historiography: Historians also study historiography, that is, the history of the writing and interpretation of history, to understand how historical perspectives and interpretations have evolved over time. Historical research is fundamental to understanding the evolution of human societies and how past events have shaped the world today. The results of historical research are often presented in the form of books, academic essays, documentaries, and museu m exhibits, among other media, and contribute to our appreciation and understanding of the past and its lessons fo r the present and future. Quantitative research is a scientific research approach that focuses on the collection and analysis of numerical data and sta tistics to understand, describe and explain phenomena, populations or events. This method is based on the measurement and quantification of variables and uses statistical techniques to analyze the data. Here is a more detailed definition: Quantitative research is a scientific research approach that involves the systematic collection of numerical data and its statistical analysis to understand and explain phenomena, populations, or events. In this type of research, variables that can be measure d are identified and numerical data is collected through surveys, questionnaires, structured observations or experiment s. This data is processed and analyzed using statistical techniques with the aim of identifying patterns, relationships and trends. Key features of quantitative research: 1. Measurement of variables: Relevant variables are identified and measured precisely and objectively. These variables can be quantitative (e.g., age, income) or transformed into quantitative data (e.g., opinions rated on a numerical scale). 2. Structured data collection: A standardized and structured methodology is used to collect data, a llowing for comparability and replicability. 3. Statistical analysis: Data are analyzed using statistical methods including descriptive statistics (such as means and stan dard deviations) and inferential analyzes (such as hypothesis testing and re", "source": "32.pdf"}, {"id": 27, "text": "ve data (e.g., opinions rated on a numerical scale). 2.

Paradigms and Different Types of Research IJSSHR,Volume 06 Issue 12 December 2023 www.ijsshr.in Page 7447 4. Generalization: Often, results are sought to be generalized to larger populations or broader contexts, which requires representative samples and appropriate sampling techniques. 5. Objectivity and replicability: Quantitative research strives to be objective and replicable, meaning that other researchers should be able to conduct the same study and obtain similar results using the same data and methods. Quantitative research is especially useful for answering research questions that can be measured and analyzed quantitatively. It is used in a variety of fields, such as psychology, sociology, economics, medicine, and education, to examine relationships, ide ntify patterns, and make data-driven decisions. • Survey research and cohort studies are two research approaches used to collect data in observational studies in the field of social sciences and epidemiology. Definitions of each of these approaches are provided below: • Survey research is a research method that involves the systematic collection of information through standardized questions asked of individuals or study groups. These questions may be open -ended or closed -ended and are administered through written questionnaires, in-person interviews, t elephone, online, or other surveys. The goal of survey research is to obtain quantitative or qualitative data on opinions, attitudes, behaviors, demographic characteristics, and other variables of interest. Surveys are used in a variety of fields, including sociology, psychology, politics, marketing, and public health, among others. • Cohort studies are a specific type of observational research design in which a group of people (the cohort) are followed over time to examine how certain factors or exposures influence their health, behavior, or outcomes over time. weather.

These studies a re common in epidemiology and public health. For example, a cohort study might follow a group of people for decades to determine how certain lifestyle factors (such as diet and exercise) influence the incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes or cancer. Cohort studies can be prospective (starting in the present and following the cohort into the future) or retrospective (using existing data on a cohort that formed in the past). Both approaches, survey research and cohort studies, are valuable for understanding and analyzing a wide range of social and health phenomena. The choice between one or the other depends on the nature of the research questions and whether you seek to collec t data at a single point in time (surveys) or follow a population over a lo nger period (cohort studies). 2. Interpretative Paradigm in detail: • Qualitative research is a scientific research approach used to understand, explore, and analyze in depth the complexity of so cial, human and cultural phenomena. Unlike quantitative resea rch, which focuses on the numerical quantification of data, qualitative research focuses on the collection of descriptive and non-numerical data, such as observations, interviews, documents, and records, to capture the meaning and context of a freak. Here is a more detailed definition: Qualitative research is a scientific research approach that seeks to understand and explore the richness and complexity of so cial, cultural, or human phenomena through the collection and analysis of non-numerical data. In this approach, research techniques such as participant observation, in -depth interviews, content analysis, textual analysis, and document analysis are used to explore the experiences, perspectives, and contexts of the participants or study subjects. Qualitati ve research focuses on the interpretation and understanding of reality from the perspective of the people involved in the phenomenon studied.

Qualitati ve research focuses on the interpretation and understanding of reality from the perspective of the people involved in the phenomenon studied. Key features of qualitative research: Descriptive and context-rich data: Narrative and descriptive data are collec ted that capture the complexity and richness of human and social experiences. In-Depth Exploration: Researchers seek to understand the perspectives and underlying meanings of participants, often using open - ended interviews and immersion in context. Selective sampling: Instead of random samples, purposive or selective sampling is used to choose participants or cases that are especially informative or relevant to the research. Contextualization: Qualitative research focuses on understanding the context in which phenomena occur, including social, cultural, and temporal factors. Methodological flexibility: Researchers can adapt their methods and approaches as they progress through the research, allowing for greater flexibility and responsiveness to emerging findings. Qualitative research is widely used in disciplines such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, education, health, and social sciences in general. It provides a deep understanding of human and social phenomena, and its results can contribute to riche r theories and the formulation of evidence-based policies and practices. • Case study research is a qualitative research approach used to thoroughly explore a particular phenomenon, event, organizatio n, or situation, with the aim of understanding it in its real-world context and providing a detailed and rich description. This methodology involves an exhaustive and in-depth investigation into a specific case or a set of similar cases. Case study research is a qualitative research method that focuses on the close examination of a singular case or a limited set of cases, with the aim of obtaining a deep and contextualized understanding of a phenomenon or situation in its natural setting. This approach involves the collection and analysis of data from multiple s ources, such as interviews, observations, documents, and records, to provide a rich and detailed description of the case or cases studied.

This method is used in various disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, education, administration, and social science research, when seeking to deepen the understanding of complex and contextual phenomena. In summary, case study research is a qualitative methodology that focuses on the detailed and contextualized exploration of specific cases to gain an in-depth understanding of a phenomenon or situation in its natural setting. This approach is especially useful when seeking rich, contextualized information rather than broad generalizations. • Ethnographic research is a qualitative research approach used to study and understand the cultural practices, b eliefs, values, and behavior of human groups within their natural and everyday context. This approach involves immersion of the researcher in the environment and culture of the group studied, allowing the researcher to gain a deep and contextualized unders tanding of the experiences and perspectives of the participants. Here is a more detailed definition. Ethnographic research is a qualitative research approach that focuses on the detailed study and understanding of human cultures and communities through par ticipant observation and participation in the study environment. Ethnographic researchers spend time interacting with members of the group studied, participating in their activities, and collecting data through techniques such as direct observation, in-depth interviews, and document review.

Participant Observation: Researchers actively participate in the day -to-day activities of the group, allowing them to gain an inside perspective and in-depth understanding of participants' experiences and perspectives. Contextual data collection: Detailed data is collected about cultural practices, social interactions, norms, values, and symbols that are meaningful to the group. Holistic analysis: Data is analyzed holistically, considering the cultural and social context in which it is produced. Rich narrative: The results of ethnographic research are presented in the form of rich, descriptive narratives that show the daily lives and experiences of the participants. Ethnographic research is used in disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, education, psychology, and ethnology to explore and document cultural and social diversity. This approach is especially valuable when seeking to deeply understand the practices and perspectives of human groups within their natural and cultural context. • Grounded Theory research is used in a variety of disciplines, including sociology, psychology, nursing, and education, among others. It is especially useful when seeking to understand complex and poorly understood phenomena and when wanting to develop theories based on empirical data rather than based on pre -existing theories. This approach is valuable for generating knowledge in contexts where existing theory is limited or insufficient. Grounded Theory research is a qualitative method used to develop theories or conceptual models from empirical data collected in the field. This approach involves immersion in the study context and data collection through interviews, observations, or document analysis, as n ecessary.

This approach involves immersion in the study context and data collection through interviews, observations, or document analysis, as n ecessary. The distinctive characteristic of Grounded Theory is that it does not start from pre -existing theories or hypotheses, but rather allows theories to emerge inductively as data are collected and analyzed. Key features of Grounded Theory research: Open and axial coding: The data are analyzed using open coding, where emerging categories and themes are identified, and axial coding, where relationships are established between these categories. Constant comparison: A constant comparison is made between the data collected and the emerging categories, allowing theories to be refined and developed as the research progresses. Theoretical sampling: Selective sampling based on emerging theory is used to obtain additional data to help develop and enric h developing theories. Development of core and subordinate categories: As data is analyzed, core categories are developed that represent key concepts and subordinate categories that explain and detail these concepts. Theory construction: The goal is to build theories or conceptual frameworks that explain the phenomenon studied in a meaningful and profound way. Phenomenological research is a qualitative research approach that focuses on the study of human experiences as they are lived and perceived by participants. Th e goal is to understand and describe in depth how people interpret and give meaning to their experiences, as well as to identify underlying patterns and structures in their stories. Key features of phenomenological research: Focus on subjective experience: It focuses on the subjective experiences and perceptions of individuals, trying to capture what people feel and how they interpret their reality. Phenomenological reduction: Researchers apply a technique called \"phenomenological reduction\" to suspend prio r judgments and preconceptions and focus on the experience as it is lived by the participants.

As a synthesis The relationship between epistemological paradigms and research traditions is fundamental to understanding how research processes are approached in various disciplines. These research paradigms and traditions coexist and intertwine in research practice, and researchers choose appr oaches based on their objectives and research questions. The choice of paradigm and tradition affects the methodology, methods, and interpretation of results in research. Epistemological paradigms significantly influence the methods, procedures, techniques, and language used in different research traditions. These relationships demonstrate how epistemological paradigms guide the choice of methods and techniques, as well as the language used in research. Each paradigm has its own philosophical and methodological premises that influence how research problems are addressed and knowledge is generated. REFERENCES 1) Bourdeau, M. (2003).

Paudel Tribhuvan University, Prithvi Narayan Campus, Pokhara, Nepal Abstract: Research is a systematic process involving collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data using appropriate methods and tools to investigate a specific problem or question, leading to a deeper understanding of the issue. The framework and execution of research are inherently tied to the philosophical paradigms that underpin it. The philosophical paradigm in research encompasses fundamental elements, namely ontology, epistemology, axiology, and methodology, shaping the presumptions, norms, beliefs, and values inherent in the research process. This study aimed to delineate the shifts in philosophical perspectives within social research, utilizing content analysis. The examinati on and interpretation of document contents highlight the prevalence of positivist and post-positivist paradigms as traditional frameworks predominantly advocating quantitative research. In contrast, newer paradigms such as interpretivist/constructivist, cr itical, postmodern, and multiparadigmatic philosophies emphasize qualitative and mixed research designs advocate for qualitative and mixed methods research. This study highlights the significant influence of philosophical paradigms on research design and processes, emphasizing the need for researchers to understand these paradigms thoroughly. This understanding is crucial to ensure clarity, relevance, and authenticity in research. By delineating the shifts in philosophical perspectives within social research, this study provides valuable insights into how these paradigms shape research endeavors.

This understanding is crucial to ensure clarity, relevance, and authenticity in research. By delineating the shifts in philosophical perspectives within social research, this study provides valuable insights into how these paradigms shape research endeavors. Keywords: philosophical paradigms; social research; methodological shifts; quantitative research; qualitative paradigms Introduction Navigating the shifting terrain of academic inquiry, researchers adapt their methodologies to address emerging issues and changing paradigms. Research, as a rigorous exploration utilizing scientific techniques to address specific issues or problems, underg oes dynamic transformations influenced by contextual variations and shifting paradigms (Bhat, 2019) . Acknowledging these dynamic shifts becomes crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and frameworks employed in the exploration of ideas, emphasizing the continual need for adaptability and openness in the arena of scholarly investigation. Research is a systematic investigation aimed at describing, explaining, predicting, and controlling specific observed phenomena. For example, in social research, sociologists might study the impact of social media usage on adolescent mental health to understand behavioral patterns and inform policy recommendations. The research process, inherently dynamic, is subject to change along with the researcher's evolving beliefs, perspectives, contextual factors, and philosophical paradigms (Kincheloe & Tobin, 2015). The 21st century marks an era of significant transformation in social research, witnessing epistemological debates advocating for diverse research approaches and challenging traditional methods (Taylor & Medina, 2013). In the ever-evolving landscape of research, acknowledging these dynamic shifts becomes crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and frameworks employed in the research process. Within the complex mosaic of social research, the philosophical paradigm encapsulates a comprehensive belief system or worldview guiding the nature and practice within a research field (Mackenzie and Knipe, 2006). Serving as a conceptual framewo rk of methodology, methods, theoretical perspectives , and epistemology, it allows researchers to examine the Open access article RESEARCH ARTICLE J. Univ.

This paradigm, comprising a set of worldviews, directs and guides research actions or investigations (Guba and Lincoln, 1994). Viewed by Denzin and Lincoln.(2005) as a human construction, it repres ents the means through which researchers construct knowledge embedded in the data, highlighting the significant influence of philosophical underpinnings on the research endeavor. In the intricate journey of research, locating specific studies within a phil osophical paradigm is a deliberate and guided endeavor. The beliefs inherent to the chosen paradigm shape the researcher's selected research design. (Lincoln and Guba, 1985, Crotty, 1998, Bryman, 2016) . A philosophical paradigm, serving as a foundational framework, encompasses ontology, epistemology, axiology, and methodology. This paradigm is underpinned by unique bases and assumptions related to these elements, playing a pivotal role in shaping the researcher's approach and design. (Lincoln and Guba, 1985, Crotty, 2020) . In essen ce, it underscores the profound impact of philosophical considerations on the intricate fabric of the research landscape. Exploring the fundamental framework of philosophical considerations, ontology, a branch of philosophy, analyzes into the nature of ex istence or reality (Scotland, 2012). This comprehensive analysis into the essence of existence serves as a foundational element in shaping the philosophical underpinnings of research methodologies and frameworks. It addresses the belief that something is real and accredits the nature of the phenomenon the researcher believes in. This element aids in conceptualizing the form and nature of reality, enabling researchers to formulat e hypotheses about it. Scott and Usher.(2004) emphasize the importance of ontology in social research, as it provides knowledge about the phenomenon being investigated or explored.

Scott and Usher.(2004) emphasize the importance of ontology in social research, as it provides knowledge about the phenomenon being investigated or explored. Kivunja and Kuyini.(2017) assert that understanding how evidence is interpreted requires considering philosophical beliefs about the nature of reality. The philosophical concepts, propositions, or assumptions help familiarize the researcher's thinking about research problems, objectives, significance, and approaches to answering research questions (Bryman, 2012, Crotty, 2020, Cariaga, 2023) . Philosophy, linked to rationality and science, seeks deeper truths about the cosmos and our place in it. Through epistemology, philosophers examine whether knowledge comes from sensory experience or internal conceptions and through axiology, it tries to explore the researchers’ position to manipulate the information or data. In the exploration for understanding the intricacies of knowledge generation, epistemology, another crucial element, explores how knowledge is formed (Taylor and Medina, 2013) . This critical examination of the nature of knowledge not only shapes the foundations of research methodologies but also lays the groundwork for the researcher's approach in navigating the complexities of their chosen field. It is a view about the type of knowledge that can be generated and standardized for justification. The nature of knowledge and its justification play a vital role in theoretical perspectives and methodology, infused with the notion of knowing (Crotty, 2020). In addition to exploring ho w knowledge is formed, epistemology delves into the multifaceted nature of knowledge beyond mere true beliefs. It encompasses the social construction of knowledge, acknowledging its dependency on cultural and societal contexts (Bryman, 2012, Cariaga, 2023) . Moreover, epistemology considers the reliability and validity of information, emphasizing the importance of robust methodologies in knowledge generation. Furthermore, it recognizes the diversity of knowledge, accommodating various perspectives and paradigms (Taylor and Medina, 2013, Crotty, 2020) .

Moreover, epistemology considers the reliability and validity of information, emphasizing the importance of robust methodologies in knowledge generation. Furthermore, it recognizes the diversity of knowledge, accommodating various perspectives and paradigms (Taylor and Medina, 2013, Crotty, 2020) . Practical or experiential knowledge is also valued, highlighting its significance alongside theoretical understandings. Thus, epistemology navigates t he complexities of knowledge generation by encompassing a broad spectrum of factors, from social influences on practical applications, beyond the realm of truth alone. Epistemology in research seeks answers regarding the nature of language, ways of achieving knowledge, the relationship between the given and new knowledge, and the relationship between the researcher and their reflection (Creswell and Clark, 2014, Kivunja and Kuyini, 2017) . The researcher thoughtfully utilizes those inquiries to position themselves within the study framework, investigating what is novel and what is assumed. Axiology, the theory of reasoning, brings ethical considerations to the forefront while framing a research report or proposal or even during the whole research process (Finnis, 2011) . Axiology is a philosophical approach that aids in deciding value or logic (Kivunja and Kuyini, 2017) . It concerns what things or ideas are considered valuable in the research and how these values are treated by the researcher. This encompasses the value the researcher attributes to different aspects of research, including informants, data, and the audiences to which research results are reported. J. Univ.

Methodology demonstrates the logic and progression of organized procedures used to carry out a research project or learn more about the study subject. Theoretical perspectives serve as philosophical frameworks that inform methodological choices by contextualizing processes and establishing their rationale and criteria. Researchers often hold certain assumptions regarding their chosen methodologies for specific research endeavors, elucidating these assumptions within the broader theoretical context to enhance the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of the methodology (Crotty, 2020). Through the elucidation of theoretical perspectives, researchers gain insights into the human world and social phenomena, anchoring methodological assumptions within a broader theoretical framework. Each research paradigm t reats these four elements; ontology, epistemology, axiology, and methodology in a distinct manner. The philosophical paradigms for a social researcher are crucial, offering opinions and rules that determine what and how research should be conducted, how da ta should be gathered and examined, and how outcomes should be understood. Every decision made during the research process is guided by the philosophical framework in which the researcher situates their work. Lack of familiarity with the research paradigm can hinder the researcher's ability to conduct research with appropriate processes and ethics. As an educator and researcher, interactions with colleagues pursuing M. Phil. and Ph.D. degrees reveal their challenges in determining the philosophical roots guiding their research designs. Colleagues often seek assistance in filling out ontological, epistemological, and axiological aspects of their research. Similar challenges arise when supervising Master’s students' theses. Without determining the paradigm, t here is no basis for further choices in terms of methodology, methods, literature, and research design itself (Mackenzie and Knipe, 2006) . Many problems in the social sciences and humanities hinge on selecting an appropriate paradigm, a challenging task for researchers.

Ultimately, a well -chosen paradigm is crucial for the coherence and success of the research endeavour. These experiences have prompted the preparation of theoretical literature on research paradigms. This article endeavours to comprehensively review, analyse, and interpret philosophical paradigms in social research, aiming to equip researchers with the awareness and awareness required to select appropriate research designs in social contexts. As social researchers navigate the complexities of their studies, the elements of ontology, epistemology, axiology, theoretical perspectives , and methodology play piv otal roles in shaping the researcher's worldview and guiding their research design (Crotty, 2020). The ongoing evolution of research paradigms, as observed in the 21 st century, highlights the importance of embracing diverse epistemological perspectives an d breaking away from traditional approaches (Bryman, 2012) . For researchers and educators alike, being cognizant of the philosophical underpinnings becomes imperativ e in fostering a conscious and aware approach to selecting research designs aligned with the social context. The expression and investigation of these paradigms contribute to formulating a theoretical framework that aids researchers in tackling challenges and making well-informed decisions during the research process.

Results and Discussion Throughout the history of social research, a multitude of philosophical paradigms have directed researchers across diverse fields of study, moulding their examinations of policies and practices. These paradigms exert their influence over theories pertaining to social phenomena, spanning areas such as education, sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, public health, and political science. Within these disciplines, philosophical paradigms inform research into teaching and learning methodologies, curriculum development, professional growth strategies, evaluation methodologies, resource creation, community development, social justice initiatives, and various other dimensions of social inquiry. Classical Paradigms Classical paradigms act as philosophical foundations guiding quantitative research methodologies, focusing on data quantification to uncover fundamental truths, though some of the classical approaches focus on qualitative research as well. These traditiona l philosophical paradigms, typically associated with research preceding the 1980s, are considered tried and trusted frameworks (Taylor and Medina, 2013) . Within the area of social research, positivist and post- positivist philosophical paradigms are acknowledged as fundamental representatives of these traditional approaches. However, Interpretivist paradigms, commonly associated with contemporary qualitative research, are also considered traditional or classical by some scholars due to their foundational role in shaping qualitative inquiry (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005) . Ponterotto.(2005) emphasizes interpretivism's historical influence on counselling psychology, while Schwandt (2014) discusses its context within the framework of historical development. These citations collectively highlight interpretivism's recognition as part of the traditional approach to qualitative research. Positivist Paradigm Positivism, as a paradigm, is dedicated to exploring, confirming, and predicting reality, rooted in the philosophy introduced by August Comte and characterized by the scientific method of investigation though Benthan and Descrates come first (Kivunja and Kuyini, 2017) . According to Creswell.(2014), positivists, also referred to as instructivists, assert that reality exists and can be discovered, measu red, and manipulated.

According to Creswell.(2014), positivists, also referred to as instructivists, assert that reality exists and can be discovered, measu red, and manipulated. Taylor and Medina.(2013) suggest that the positivist paradigm finds common usage in graduate research for testing theories or hypotheses, particularly in natural and physical sciences or, to some extent, in social science, especially when dealing with large sample sizes. Fadhel.(2002) emphasizes that research grounded in positivism follows a deductive approach, formulating and testing hypotheses, quantifying objective data through mathematical calculations, and expressing reality and knowledge to derive conclusions (Cohen et al., 2010) . affirm that the positivist paradigm offers explanations and predictions based on measurable outcomes, characterized by determinism, empiricism, parsimony, and generalizability. This paradigm, predominantly aligned with quantitative methodology, employs experimental methods or surveys on extensive informant samples, presenting results in mathematical notations. However, some researchers have attempted to apply positivist principle s to qualitative research, emphasizing rigor, replicability, and systematic data collection to ensure objectivity. Silverman.(2010) discusses adopting rigor and systematic approaches in qualitative studies, while Miles et al.,(2014) highlight the importance of systematic data analysis and coding. Seale.(1999) explores applying objectivity and rigor standards to enhance qualitative research quality. Additionally, Morse et al.,(2002) describe verification strategies to establish reliability and validity in qualitative research, reflecting positivist concerns. Despite these efforts, the core tenets of positivism are more naturally suited to quantitative methods. J. Univ. Ruhuna 2024 12(1): 45-58 P. Paudel Journal of the University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka 12(1), 2024 49 The ontology of positivism reflects naive realism, subscribing to a single reality.

Burns.(2000) describes experimental methodology within positivism as involving the manipulation of one variable to determine its impact on another variable Mertens.(2014) justifies the axiology of beneficence, asserting that social research should aim to maximize positive outcomes, minimizing risks or harm during the research process. A practical example illustrating the positivist paradigm in a research project is shown in box 1. Post-Positivist Philosophical Paradigm Amidst the challenges faced by researchers in comprehending the complexities of research and its contextual details, a paradigm shift emerged, challenging the notion that the social world can be understood in the same manner as the natural world. This transformative shift in belief and worldview gave rise to the post -positivist philosophical paradigm. Guba and Lincoln.(1994) contends that post - positivism acknowledges that reality is inherently elusive, emphasizing approximation and providing a conceptual framework for research conducted on human behavior within social contexts. This paradigm acknowledges the imperfection of reality and the non- absoluteness of truth, characterizing it as probable rather than definitive. According to Willis.(2007), post-positivism represents a more tempered iteration of positivism, maintaining similar principles while allowing for increased interaction between the researcher and informants. (Creswell, 2015) notes that post-positivism introduces additional research tools, such as survey research, observation, and interviews, which were optional within the positivist framework. Taylor and Medina.(2013) perceive it as a modified version of the scientific method tailored for social science and social research. The overarching goal of the post -positivist paradigm is to generate objective and generalizable knowledge concerning social patterns or universal properties in the relationships among pre-defined variables.

The overarching goal of the post -positivist paradigm is to generate objective and generalizable knowledge concerning social patterns or universal properties in the relationships among pre-defined variables. The fundamental differences between positivist and post-positivist paradigms lie in their perspectives on objectivity and the nature of reality, as well as in their approaches to knowledge and theory. Positivism adheres to the belief in an objective reality that can be observed and measured, striving for empirical verification and generalizable laws (Creswell, 2014) . In contrast, post-positivism recognizes the presence of subjectivity and acknowledges the role of interpretation in shaping our understanding of reality, advocating for the consideration of multiple perspectives and the importance of reflexivity (Guba and Lincoln, 1994). Regarding knowledge, positivism views knowledge as objective and absolute, while post-positivism sees knowledge as socially constructed and acknowledges the influence of context and interpretation on knowledge formation (Creswell, 2014). In terms of theory, positivism emphasizes the development of universal laws and causal relationships, often through deductive reasoning, while post -positivism allows for more flexibility in theory-building, accommodating diverse perspectives and interpretations (Guba and Lincoln, 1994) . An illustrative example in box 2 from a social science research context demonstrates how the post -positivist paradigm manifests in the comprehensive processes of research. between culture, context, and research paradigms has resulted in a noteworthy transformation in the philosophical underpinnings of research endeavours. Researchers, rooted in diverse domains of pedagogy, now find themselves aligning w ith philosophical paradigms such as interpretive, critical, pragmatic, multi-paradigmatic, and postmodern approaches. This diversity reflects a recognition of the complex and multifaceted nature of social phenomena. Interpretivist/Constructivist Paradigm Philosophical paradigms are pivotal in shaping researchers' perspectives and methodologies within the dynamic landscape of social research. Box 1.

This experimental research utilized both experimental and control groups, with the former exposed to a treatment involving the use of journal articles in teaching reading. The research's ontology embraced a single reality, its epistemology sought objective knowledge justified from reality, and its methodology was quantitative, underpinning the entire research process. The presentation and statistical analysis of data followed a descriptive approach, emphasizing validity and reliability as quantitative standards in each table. J. Univ. Ruhuna 2024 12(1): 45-58 P. Paudel Journal of the University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka 12(1), 2024 50 One such paradigm, the interpretivist paradigm, stands out for its deeply involved and participatory approach to understanding the complex intricate web of human experience within various social contexts. This paradigm, characterized by an in-depth exploration of subjective realities and multiple perspectives, contrasts sharply with traditional positivist and post- positivist paradigms. At the core of the interpretivist paradigm lies the researcher's engagement with the authentic field of study. Guba and Lincoln.(1994) concede that this paradigm encourages researchers to establish rapport with participants by actively participating, observing, or interviewing them. The central tenet of interpretivism revolves around exploring into the subjective world of human experience, emphasizing the unique interpretations individuals attribute to their surroundings (Guba and Lincoln, 1994, Bogdan and Biklen, 1998) .

Unlike positivist and post -positivist approaches, interpretive knowledge in this paradigm emerges as a result of prolonged interactions, with theory evolving concurrently with the research process. Social research within the interpretivist paradigm provides researchers with a subtle perception of individuals and their cultural contexts. Punch.(2005) asserts that researchers construct knowledge through personal experiences within the natural settings under investigation, extracting mea ning through cognitive processing and interactions with participants. Chalmers et al.,(2005) further, highlight that the interpretivist paradigm facilitates the exploration of multiple realities and the reconstruction of meaning through human interactions. Data collection strategies in interpretive research are diverse and include interviews, discourse analysis, text messages, reflective sessions, focus group discussions, participant observation, and document analysis. This variety of tools allows researchers to triangulate, integrate, and interpret data collected from various sources, enriching the d epth of understanding (Kivunja and Kuyini, 2017) . The interpretivist paradigm fosters a value-laden approach, treating each participant and process with equal importance and striving for a balanced representation of findings. As a qualitative research design, the interpretivist paradigm finds expression in various methodologies, including case studies, naturalistic research, grounded theory, phenomenological research, ethnography, phenomenography, and action research (Guba and Lincoln, 1994, Josselson, 2007) . These methodologies, rooted in interpretive philosophical paradigms, contribute to a rich and detailed exploration of social phenomena. To illustrate the practical application of the interpretivist paradigm in social science research, consider a study focused on understanding the impact of educational interventions on student learning experiences as shown in box 3.

Pragmatic Paradigm The emergence of the pragmatic paradigm in social research was a response to the limitations and critiques leveled against the positivist and interpretivist paradigms. Philosophers argued against the notion that a singular scientific method could access the ultimate truth about the real world, and they questioned the feasibility of determining social reality through th ese paradigms. According to Biesta.(2010), the pragmatic Box 2 . Example of a Research Having Post - Positivist Paradigm The research entitled “Navigating Complexity: Understanding the Multifaceted Impact of Social Media on Adolescent Well -Being\" employs a post -positivist paradigm to study the intricate link between adolescent well-being and social media usage. Recognizing the complexity of this relationship, it adopts a mi xed- methods approach, combining qualitative methods like in-depth interviews and focus groups with 50 diverse adolescents, alongside quantitative surveys to capture both data patterns and qualitative insights. Additionally, content analysis of social media posts enriches the understanding of adolescents' online experiences. Data analysis involves grounded theory and thematic analysis, revealing emergent themes and patterns. Embracing the post-positivist perspective, this research offers nuanced insights int o the multifaceted nature of social media's impact on adolescent well - being, informing holistic strategies for supporting youth in the digital age.

In the realm of social research, Alise and Teddlie.(2010) assert that the pragmatic paradigm promotes research methods deemed most suitable for studying a particular phenomenon. It emphasizes the adoption of practical research designs and encourages a pluralistic approach to understanding the behaviours of informants. This paradigm seeks to employ diverse methodologies that are most effective in gaining knowledge and discovering new insights. An example of pragmatic paradigm is action research. Action research aligns well with the pragmatist paradigm, which emphasizes practical solutions and real -world applications. Pragmatism values both quantitative and qualitative methods, focusing on practical implications over strict methodology. Action research reflects this by iteratively refining interventions ba sed on empirical evidence and feedback. As noted by Creswell.(2014), pragmatism prioritizes research outcomes and utility , aligning with action research's goal of fostering positive change (Creswell and Clark, 2014). Bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative approaches, Kivunja and Kuyini.(2017) affirm that the pragmatist paradigm is characterized by relational epistemology, acknowledgment of multiple realities, employment of mixed -methods methodology, and a value-laden axiology. The emphasis is on the workability and practical utility of actions suited for investigating a specific phenomenon. This implies that the pragmatic philosophical paradigm in social research advocates for the flexibi lity to use both qualitative and quantitative research methods based on the specific needs, objectives, and contextual nuances of the research endeavor.

The pragmatic paradigm's application in social research extends to a diverse range of studies, where researchers navigate the intricacies of human behavior, societal dynamics, and complex phenomena. For instance, in exploring the effectiveness of educational interventions in enhancing student learning experiences, a pragmatic approach may involve integrati ng qualitative methods such as in - depth interviews and participant observation with quantitative surveys and assessments. This methodological pluralism allows researchers to capture the multifaceted nature of the phenomenon under investigation, providing a more comprehensive and contextually grounded understanding. Furthermore, the pragmatic paradigm advocates for the pragmatic use of research methods that align with the practical realities of the research context. It encourages researchers to be responsive to the dynamic nature of social phenomena and adopt methodologies that are not only theoretically sound but also feasible and effective in uncovering the complexities inherent in various social settings. Artificial intelligence, as a recent digital tool, embodies pragmatism by focusing on practical solutions and real-world applications. It leverages both data-driven (quantitative) and context -aware (qualitative) approaches, prioritizing utility and effectiveness, aligning with the pragmatist emphasis on actionable knowledge and tangible results. In essence, the pragmatic philosophical paradigm in social research promotes a holistic and adaptive approach, recognizing the need for methodological diversity to address the nuanced nature of social phenomena. Researchers operating within this paradigm navigate the area of social research with an emphasis on practicality, utility, and the application of methods that best serve the objectives of their studies.

Example Showing Interpretivist/Constructivist Paradigm The research Exploring Adolescents' Subjective Experiences: A Qualitative Study of Social Media and Well-Being employs an interpretivist/constructivist paradigm to explore adolescents' subjective experiences with social media and well -being. Instead of pursuing objective truths, it seeks to understand the unique meanings and perspectives adolescents associate with their social media interactions. Through qualitative methods like in -depth interviews and participant observation with 20 adolescents aged 13 to 18, this study captures rich narratives. It emphasizes the collaborative meaning -making process between researchers and participants, acknowledging the influence of social and cultural contexts. Thematic coding, narra tive analysis, and constant comparison will uncover underlying themes. This approach provides a profound understanding of how adolescents interpret their social media experiences and their implications for well -being, contributing to a nuanced comprehension of the interplay between subjectivity and social media in adolescent lives.

In the realm of social research, scholars such as Brookfield.(2000) emphasize that researchers embracing the critical paradigm undergo a process of raising their critical consciousness, constructing a moral vision for a better society, and actively advocating for change. Positioned as change agents, researchers within this paradigm champion the ideals of equity, fairness, and sustainability. The critical paradigm unfolds as a powerful force seeking to dismantle oppressive structures and foster a more just and inclusive social order. Critical inquiry within this paradigm fosters teachers' imaginative and analytical thinking, influencing aspects such as curriculum design, assessment strategies, and the adoption of student -centered, culturally sensitive teaching methods. The critical paradigm operates on a transactional epis temology, fostering regular interactions between the researcher and informants. Rooted in historical realist ontology, it acknowledges and addresses societal oppression. The methodology it employs is often dialogic, and its axiology is characterized by a p rofound respect for cross-cultural norms and values (Kivunja and Kuyini, 2017). At the heart of the critical paradigm's focus in research is the unveiling of hidden agencies within social practices, ultimately aiming for liberatio n and emancipation. Methodologies aligned with the critical paradigm include Neo -Marxist theories, feminist perspectives, cultural studies, queer theory, action research, participatory emancipation, and critical race theory. These methodologies collectively contribute to a robust framework that seeks to engage with and dismantle systems of injustice and inequity. The critical philosophical paradigm, therefore, emerges as a potent advocate for research that delves into social justice concerns, amplifying the voices of the marginalized, and supporting and empowering those who lack power.

The postmodern paradigm, as elucidated by Denzin and Lincoln.(2005), emerges as a new and stimulating avenue for social researchers by focusing on representation, acknowledging that internal thoughts and emotions are not directly accessible to the external world. This paradigm directs attention towards what is reflected in context and culture, challenging assumptions and emphasizing the need to explo re and particularize research findings in their specific contexts. The postmodern paradigm shares affinities with interpretive and critical paradigms, diverging from the positivist approach. Taylor and Medina.(2013) highlight the shift in philosophical thoughts, noting that education reports influenced by positivism maintain an objective tone using third -person gender- neutral pronouns and passive voice. However, the emergence of interpr etive and critical paradigms has introduced alternative means of representation, allowing the voices of both researchers and informants to be revealed in the first person.

A fundamental tenet of the postmodernist paradigm is the belief that social research, its practices, and findings cannot be isolated from social practices and cultural traditions. Prendergast et al.,(2009) argue that, closely aligned with interpretivism and criticism, the postmodernist paradigm extends its embrace to other disciplines, particularly the arts. (Knowles and Cole, 2007) underscore the diversification of art -based social research, incorporating literary genres like autobiographical writing, impressionist writing, and visual imaginaries such as film and photography. In this paradigm, researchers have acces s to various alternative modes of reasoning, similar to interpretive and critical paradigms. In the field of social research, the postmodern paradigm is employed by scholars to navigate the complexities of representation, acknowledging the fluidity and multiplicity of truths. By adopting diverse modes of inquiry, including artistic expressions and narrative approaches, researchers within the postmodern paradigm contribute to a more nuanced and contextually rich understanding of social phenomena. This paradigm invites continual reflection on the dynamic interplay between researchers, subjects, and the broader socio -cultural landscape, fostering a research ethos that appreciates the intricate tapestry of human experiences.

The foundational philosophy of the multi - paradigmatic paradigm aligns with beliefs in multiple realities, subjective knowledge, a process -based dialogic methodology, and ideological axiology. By accepting the coexistence of various paradigms, this approach acknowledges the intricate and multifaceted nature of social phenomena. The acknowledgment of multiple realities allows researchers to navigate the intricacies of diverse contexts, enriching the depth and breadth of their investigations. The subjective knowledge emphasis underscores the importance of individual perspectives and experiences, fostering a more inclusive and holistic understanding of the studied phenomena. In the field of social research, the multi -paradigmatic approach opens avenues for researchers to engage with a broader spectrum of methodologies and epistemological stances. This not only enr iches the research process but also enhances the applicability and relevance of findings in varied contexts. The ideological axiology inherent in this paradigm encourages researchers to critically examine and consider the values and ideologies embedded in their research, contributing to a more reflexive and ethically grounded research practice. In essence, the multi - paradigmatic research paradigm emerges as a dynamic and adaptable framework that responds to the complexities of social research. By transcendi ng traditional boundaries and incorporating diverse philosophical perspectives, this approach contributes to a more nuanced, inclusive, and contextually sensitive understanding of the multifaceted social realities under investigation.

In positivist research, quality standards prioritize objectivity, rigor, and replica bility (Creswell, 2014) . Researchers maintain neutrality to ensure unbiased findings (Trochim and Donnelly, 2007). Clear, consistent methods allow for replication and reliability (Campbell et al., 1963). Validity is ensured through internal and external validity checks (Bryman, 2016). Precise measurement and quantitative analysis yield accurate data (Kerlinger and Lee, 2000). Testable hypotheses guide experimental designs for establishing causality (Babbie, 2010). Rigorous st atistical methods validate conclusions (Field., 2013). Adhering to these standards aims to produce objective, reliable, and generalizable knowledge. Similarly, quality standards within post positivist paradigm, such as objectivity, validity, and reliability, can be enhanced through the application of triangula tion, simultaneously employing multiple data sources, methods, and theories (Guba and Lincoln, 1994). This paradigm directs and guides the worldview of quantitative research in a manner akin to the positivist paradigm. Trustworthiness, a crucial aspect in interpretive research, is multifaceted, encompassing credibility, dependability, transferability, and conformability. Credibility, akin to internal validity, is established through prolonged immersion in the field and continuous validation with informants (Guba and Lincoln, 1994) . Dependability, reflecting the consistency of findings, is maintained through open - ended or emergent inquiry, ensuring reliability in the research process. Transferability, or the generalization of findings to different contexts, is facilitated by rich descriptions and purposeful sampling. Conformability ensures that the research process aligns with a specific methodological framework, adding a layer of authenticity to the study.

This example highlights how the postmodern paradigm is reflected in social science research, emphasizing the contextual and subjective nature of knowledge construction. Conclusion This review explored into diverse philosophical paradigms preva lent in social research by meticulously studying, scrutinizing, and interpreting ideas sourced from various published and online materials. The findings highlight the crucial role that philosophical paradigms play in shaping the ontology, epistemology, and axiology within research, subsequently influencing the methodological approaches adopted. Each paradigm, underpinned by specific assumptions, signifies a commitment to a particular nature of ontology, epistemology, and axiology, thereby guiding the incorporation of specific methodologies in research endeavors.

Omodan endeavors to navigate the difficult course between trying to give credence to all the paradigms which he discusses, while urging us to continue to reflect upon the consequences of how we invoke them. He also subtly introduces as a general ethical guideline that we should (as expressly advised within transformative and Indigenous paradigms), reflect upon how research can be designed to “provide a space for inclusive decision making and co-learning, cultivating an environment where [professional] researchers’ and community members’ insights and wisdom are valued” (Omodan, 2024, p. 128).

Keywords: critical self -reflection, impact of research in society, interpreting research products, ongoing paradigmatic discussion, relevance of research, transformative potential of research Introduction This book sets out to offer a way of bridging the divide between philosophical concepts associated with different paradigmatic stances and practical research considerations, in a manner which is accessible to readers of varying levels of research experience. Omodan’s 2762 The Qualitative Report 2024 inclusion of a plethora of examples of research questions, research designs, data collection processes, data analysis processes and ethical considerations that may spring from any invoked paradigmatic position is illuminating in spotlighting the difference between paradigmatic positions. At the same time, he points to ongoing controversies surrounding the quest to organize valuable social science research.

Review The book is divided into six chapters (with an initial “Justification and Chapter Overview”: pp. xi - xiv). In Chapter 1, he introduces the origin of the concept of “research paradigm” and explains how different paradigms arose in the social sciences in terms of their ontologies, epistemologies, axiologies, and methodological guidelines. This chapter, entitled “Understanding Research Paradigms,” offers some case studies of how the framing of research questions can already be seen as linked to paradigmatic orientations on the part of researchers. For example, when outlining a “ postcolonial indigenous paradigmatic” formulation of a research question, he notes that a research question to ask could be: “how do colonial policies and practices impact the wellbeing of Indigenous youth, and what strategies can be employed to promote cultural realization and empowerment?” (p. 17). The suggestion in this case is that the research must resonate with issues of concern in the community, that the youth and other community members should be involved in defining how the research should proceed, and in deciding what (participatory) methods should be employed to help explore together how cultural revitalization efforts can be enhanced. These implications all “align” with the philosophical tenets of a postcolonial indigenous paradigm. (This is not to say that Omodan believes that there are no deba table issues associated with this paradigm, which indeed he explores in his chapter devoted to this paradigm, namely, Chapter 5.) Also in his first chapter, Omodan offers an example of how, for instance, one can set a research question based in a positivist -oriented paradigm, seeking to explore “the impact of a specific teaching methodology on students’ academic performance – as measured in terms of certain standardized indicators of performance in a secondary school” (p 15). One could here set up pre -and post-tests and compare the scores of students who were subjected to the new method with those not subjected to it. Omodan provides this as an example of how positivist researchers consider that such an approach allows researchers to draw (causal) inferences based on “measurable outcomes” and to render the research replicable (in similar contexts) so that other researchers too can check the “findings .” The idea is to collect and analyze “objectiv", "source": "_Engaging with Paradigmatic Stances in Social Science Research__.pdf"}, {"id": 86, "text": "were subjected to the new method with those not subjected to it. Omodan provides this as an example of how positivist researchers consider that such an approach allows researchers to draw (causal) inferences based on “measurable outcomes” and to render the research replicable (in similar contexts) so that other researchers too can check the “findings .” The idea is to collect and analyze “objective data on the impact of the teaching method” (p 16). Omodan does not try to deconstruct the idea of “objective data” here, as he is explaining how within a positivist framework, measurable outcomes constitute objective data (not inhering in the minds of researchers). Also, the issue of how professional researchers could try to work with participants (including youth) to explore together ways of “teaching” (and learning) that is more culturally responsive (and not based on standardized indicators of performance) does not arise. Omodan does not draw this out for readers but leaves it to us to recognize that a different way of posing a research question, a different relationship between professional researchers and others, and a different stance regarding how “results” are to be interpreted, etc., can be traced back to paradigmatic positions. Omodan proceeds in this way in relation to all the paradigms which he outlines in this chapter, in his effort to do justice to all the philosophical positions. In explaining paradigms other than positivism, he points out that “researchers in these paradigms are more likely to acknowledge their values and subjectivity and actively engage in reflexivity to understand their impact [influence] on the research process ” (p. 11). It is in this way that he offers, somewhat subtly, his preference for a more reflexive stance. All the while, in this beginning chapter (Chapter 1) he tries to alert readers to the complexities governing the Ana Inês Lourenço da Costa, Maria da Luz Jansénio Monteiro de Almeida Fonseca Rosa, 2763 and Paula Manuela Jorge Diogo research field (as a whole), which could lead to dialogue with and across paradigms. He argues that these complexities revolve around: Questions of objectivity and subjectivity, debates on validity and reliability, power dynamics and representation, ethical considerations, the role of theory and generalisability, the ongoing qualitative -quantitative debate, paradigm compatibility and inte ", "source": "_Engaging with Paradigmatic Stances in Social Science Research__.pdf"}, {"id": 87, "text": " Diogo research field (as a whole), which could lead to dialogue with and across paradigms. He argues that these complexities revolve around: Questions of objectivity and subjectivity, debates on validity and reliability, power dynamics and representation, ethical considerations, the role of theory and generalisability, the ongoing qualitative -quantitative debate, paradigm compatibility and inte gration, the influence of context and reflexivity, the dynamic nature of paradigms, and the impact of paradigms on research outcomes. Recognising these complexities is crucial for researchers as they embark on their research journey. (p. 18) He argues that if researchers are more attuned to “understanding the paradigm landscape,” which he is hoping the book will contribute to, this will lead to their: Promoting reflexivity and self-awareness, embracing flexibility and openness, utilising methodological pluralism, engaging in collaborative and participatory research, pursuing continuous learning and professional development, considering ethical considerations, engaging in reflexive iteration, participating in scholarly dialogue and debates, and seeking mentorship and collaboration. (p. 18) Having set the scene in this way (and hinted at his preference for continued scholarly dialogue and debates), he turns to a detailed examination of all the paradigms to be explored in the book. Chapter 2 is entitled “Positivist Paradigm and Methodological Alignment.” In this chapter, Omodan offers an informative exploration of the positivist paradigm, which aids readers in understanding the development of this mode of scientific thought within the social sciences. The chapter equips readers with the knowledge requir ed if they wish to apply this paradigm to their research in relation to the setting of research questions; the use of research designs which focus on relationships between measurable v ariables; the preference for quantitative methods of data collection and analysis, and the striving for “objectivity” in terms of criteria of validity which express the paradigmatic assumptions. Having explained this in detail, he offers a section in which he points to criticisms that can be levelled. His critique is structured via the following headings: • “Reductionism and Oversimplification” • “Objectivity and Value Neutrality” • “Quantitative Bias” • “Generalisability and Contextual U", "source": "_Engaging with Paradigmatic Stances in Social Science Research__.pdf"}, {"id": 88, "text": "riving for “objectivity” in terms of criteria of validity which express the paradigmatic assumptions.

His critique is structured via the following headings: • “Reductionism and Oversimplification” • “Objectivity and Value Neutrality” • “Quantitative Bias” • “Generalisability and Contextual Understanding” • “Power Dynamics and Researcher Dominance” • “Limited Emphasis on Subjective Experience” • “Ethical Considerations” He offers his own considerations, coupled with reference to (critical) research literature around these issues, in the hope, as he mentions in his initial Overview of all the chapters, to “enrich the reader’s understanding and facilitating a more nuanced approach to research” (p. xii). In Chapter 2, in his detailed discussion of positivism, he summarizes his argument that: While objectivity is emphasised within the [positivist] paradigm, it is important to recognise and address the inherent subjectivity of researchers [which cannot 2764 The Qualitative Report 2024 be ignored]. Reflexivity, acknowledging the role of subjectivity, and employing triangulation [including qualitative input in the process] are strategies that researchers can employ to ensure a balanced approach. (p. 58) In this way, Omodan extends the positivist position beyond what is normally associated with it, but he considers that this extension is not out of the question, especially if (positivist- inspired) researchers embrace a stance of reflexivity and are prepared to engage with debates in the field of social research. I found his manner of granting credibility to a positivist perspective while urging an extension hereof an interesting way for readers to engage with “positivism” in practice. He summarizes in his conclusion to Chapter 2 that: The main argument is that, by considering these aspects, researchers can conduct research within the positivist paradigm while also being cognisant of its limitations and actively engaging in a more comprehensive and well-aligned approach [where the alignment would presumably be with an extended version of positivism] (p. 58). Although he makes these caveats, I personally felt that he could have made them even more strongly!

Although he makes these caveats, I personally felt that he could have made them even more strongly! Nevertheless, I can understand that he is trying in the book to show respect for the diversity of paradigmatic approaches, while urging all researchers to take on board a stance of reflexivity regarding any assumed paradigmatic position. Chapter 3 is entitled “Interpretive /Constructive Paradigm and Methodological Alignment”. In this chapter, Omodan suggests that he is “setting the stage for a deeper understanding of its [this paradigm’s] principles and applications (p. 59). He discusses the evolution of the paradigm starting from its origin in “hermeneutic and phenomenological traditions”. He suggests that overall, this paradigm: Places importance on the researcher’s role as an active participant in the research process, engaging in dialogue and interpretation to make sense of the data collected. On the other hand, interpretive paradigm emphasises the idea of reflexivity, recognising that researchers bring their own perspectives and biases to the research process. Researchers actively reflect on their own assumptions and values, critically examining how their own positionality may influence the research design and interpretation of findings. (p. 63) When discussing the “value- laden nature of research” (as one of the topics that he explores as linked to this paradigm), he expresses, with reference to various authors, that: The interpretive paradigm acknowledges that research is value-laden and that researchers cannot be completely objective or value- neutral (Brown, 2019; Zyphur & Pierides, 2020). It emphasises the importance of transparency, ethical considerations, and respecting the voices and experiences of research participants including the critiques and debates surrounding its theoretical and methodological underpinnings. This provides a deeper appreciation of the development and refinement of the interpretive paradigm i n response to ongoing scholarly discussions and advancements in the field.

This provides a deeper appreciation of the development and refinement of the interpretive paradigm i n response to ongoing scholarly discussions and advancements in the field. (p. 67, my emphasis) As he sees it, interpretivism (in “refined” form) appreciates that professional researchers’ ways of interacting with participants means that findings, expressed as meanings, Ana Inês Lourenço da Costa, Maria da Luz Jansénio Monteiro de Almeida Fonseca Rosa, 2765 and Paula Manuela Jorge Diogo will be a product of this interaction and furthermore the interpretations of meanings should not purport to be value-neutral, as indicated in the quotation above. When I read this chapter, I pondered if he could usefully have explored the difference between an interpretivist approach which still sets out to “capture” people’s meaning-making, and an approach which is more firmly rooted in what Guba and Lincoln (2013) call a “Constructivist Credo” and what Gergen (2014, 2015, 2023) in his various writings calls a “social constructionist position , which does not define research as a world -mirroring enterprise.” In this way, Omodan could have focused more deliberately on what he calls “advancements” or developments in the field. Gergen, for instance, criticizes qualitative researchers in the interpretivist tradition who still adhere to the idea that we should strive to mirror the world(s) of people’s meaning -making (2014, p. 55). In some of the examples that Omodan supplies of possible research questions that may be posed from this paradigmatic position, the questions seem to be set as if researchers are striving to understand existing (given) meaning making of participants. For instance, he offers as one example: “What are the subjective meanings that individuals attach to the concept of ‘success’ in the context of a competitive work environment?” (p. 69). He does not highlight here that the way professional researchers frame the research question around the idea of “success” in such a workplace, could already affect how research participants might define their involvement in the workplace – without considering how discourses of success in workplaces are social constructions which can become reproduced (or questioned) through the process of “doing research.” Although Omodan has stated in various places in his text that resea", "source": "_Engaging with Paradigmatic Stances in Social Science Research__.pdf"}, {"id": 91, "text": "search question around the idea of “success” in such a workplace, could already affect how research participants might define their involvement in the workplace – without considering how discourses of success in workplaces are social constructions which can become reproduced (or questioned) through the process of “doing research.” Although Omodan has stated in various places in his text that researchers (including those adopting an interpretive/constructive approach) need to be reflexive about the impact on participants of their way of approaching the research, I felt that perhaps he should have drawn out more clearly the somewhat different positions/foci offered by interpretivists/constructivists, where the latter more explicitly admit that they are influencing everyday constructions through the manner in which they are proceeding. If one relates this back to Omodan’s point about the value-laden nature of the research enterprise, one will indeed attain a “deeper understanding of its [this paradigm’s] principles and applications” (p. 59), in which an awareness of the social construction of reality m eans that research is recognized as contributing in some way to this ongoing construction. The chapter in any case offers us as readers ongoing developments within this paradigm and prompts us to consider what reflexivity may mean in practice within this, as other paradigms. Chapter 4 is entitled “Transformative Paradigm and Methodological Alignment .” In Omodan’s initial Chapter Overview (pages xi -xiv), he expresses that Chapter 4 is aimed at presenting an “insightful dissection of the transformative paradigm and its multifaceted dimensions, serving as an essential guide for readers wishing to engage ef fectively and meaningfully with this particular research approach” (p. xiii). And in his Chapter 1, when outlining the contours of this paradigm in relation to others, he states the following: Critical/Transformative: The critical paradigm, otherwise known as transformative paradigm, focuses on power structures, social inequality, and emancipation. Researchers adopting this paradigm aim to uncover hidden power dynamics, challenge oppressive systems, and work towards soc ial change (Omodan, 2022). They also engage in critical analysis, critique existing structures, and advocate for the marginalised (Romm, 2015).

Researchers adopting this paradigm aim to uncover hidden power dynamics, challenge oppressive systems, and work towards soc ial change (Omodan, 2022). They also engage in critical analysis, critique existing structures, and advocate for the marginalised (Romm, 2015). This paradigm draws from critical theory and employs interdisciplinary approaches actively involving participants and fostering collaboration with community impacted by social injustices (Mertens, 2007). (Omodan, 2024, p. 6) 2766 The Qualitative Report 2024 He thus highlights for readers how the transformative paradigm specifically focuses on using the research process to support social justice and empowerment initiatives. The intention, he notes, is to achieve social impact, and is therefore particularly rel evant for researchers engaging with marginalized communities concerned with forwarding increased social justice issues as part of the research agenda. In his detailed discussion in Chapter 4, he expresses that: Concepts such as empowerment, liberation, voice, and agency take centre stage as researchers strive to understand and promote these elements within their studies. Assumptions about the importance of reflexivity, acknowledging positionality, and engaging in collaborative partnerships with participants are also central to the transformative paradigm. (p. 88) He expresses the importance of recognizing the theoretical foundations of the paradigm to appropriately apply the paradigm in research endeavors: Understanding the transformative paradigm in context requires recognising its theoretical foundations, interdisciplinary nature, and its commitment to social justice and empowerment. By embracing critical theory, challenging dominant ideologies, and centring the voices of marginalised communities, researchers adopting this paradigm undoubtedly contribute to transformative change and the pursuit of a more equitable society. (p. 88) Here we can see that Omodan himself is not purporting to be value -neutral in his way of explicating this paradigm (in relation to others). He proposes that the embracing of this paradigm, where researchers acknowledge their commitment to social justice and empowerment, does undoubtedly contribute to a “more equitable society”.

He proposes that the embracing of this paradigm, where researchers acknowledge their commitment to social justice and empowerment, does undoubtedly contribute to a “more equitable society”. In this chapter, he explains the origins of the paradigm in critical theory (e.g., the critical theory of the Frankfurt school) and its evolution over the years. He indicates how “t he transformative paradigm continued to evolve in the late 20th century and early 21st century, incorporating insights from postcolonial Paulo Freire, Patricia Hill Collins, and Angela Davis” (p. 89). He points out in addition that: In recent years, the transformative paradigm has increasingly engaged with issues of globalisation, environmental justice, and digital technologies. Researchers within this paradigm have explored the impact of neoliberalism on social inequalities, the environmental consequences of capitalism, and the role of digital activism in transformative change. This expansion reflects the paradigm’s responsiveness to emerging social, political, and technological challenges. (p. 89) Furthermore, he elucidates how Indigenous scholars have impacted on developments in this paradigm: Indigenous scholars, activists, and community leaders have contributed to the paradigm’s development by foregrounding decolonisation, cultural revitalisation, and indigenous knowledge systems. Similarly, the contributions of Black, feminist, queer, and disability scholars have enriched the paradigm by highlighting the intersecting oppressions faced by marginalised groups. (p. 89) Ana Inês Lourenço da Costa, Maria da Luz Jansénio Monteiro de Almeida Fonseca Rosa, 2767 and Paula Manuela Jorge Diogo I found Omodan’s incisive account of this paradigm laid a firm foundation for creating a link for readers between the theoretical discussion and its “methodological alignment.” In discussing methodological alignment in this case he refers to research questions that might be set within this paradigm, research designs that align with it (in this case co -decided with research participants), ways of collecting (or generating) relevant data (in this case towards the pursuit of social justice), ways of analyzing the “data” (such that their transformative relevan", "source": "_Engaging with Paradigmatic Stances in Social Science Research__.pdf"}, {"id": 94, "text": "l alignment.” In discussing methodological alignment in this case he refers to research questions that might be set within this paradigm, research designs that align with it (in this case co -decided with research participants), ways of collecting (or generating) relevant data (in this case towards the pursuit of social justice), ways of analyzing the “data” (such that their transformative relevance is highlighted and also such that communities and wider stakeholders can recognize the action implications of the research), and the importance of assuming a stance of reflexivity. He explains that: By cultivating a heightened awareness of their positionality, researchers within the transformative paradigm strive to mitigate power imbalances inherent in the research dynamic. This intentional self-reflection … serves as a means to foster collaborative relationships, ensuring that the research process is inclusive and ethically grounded. Through their commitment to reflexivity, the transformative researchers actively contribute to the cultivation of research practices that align with principles of equity , inclusivity, and ethical engagement. (p. 90) Through his detailed examination of the processes involved in collaborative ways of designing projects, participative styled of data collection/generation, and options for data analysis and interpretation which highlight action potential for transformative change, he offers guidance as to how indeed a transformative agenda can be built into the research process. As far as the use of different kinds of methods are concerned, he points out that “the transformative paradigm can be considered a suitable framewo rk for implementing mixed -methods research due to its emphasis on understanding complex social phenomena, promoting social justice, and generating actionable knowledge for transformative change (Mertens, 2010)” (p. 96). As part of his discussion, he does also delve into the critiques and debates that circulate around the transformative research paradigm; and he indicates how these might become accommodated.

For example, he notes that: Critics argue that the paradigm’s emphasis on social justice and transformative change may lead to a predetermined agenda that influences the research process and outcomes. They highlight the need for researchers to critically reflect on their own biases and ensure transparency in their methods to address these concerns. (p. 115) In response to these critics, he points out that: It is essential for researchers to be aware of their positionality and actively engage in reflexivity throughout the research process, acknowledging their own perspectives and potential influence on data collection, analysis, and interpretation. By embracing transparency and reflexivity, researchers can navigate these challenges. (p. 115) Here again he underscores how reflexivity is a stance that should be incorporated in all research endeavors, and he adds that this is indeed recognized by those propounding the principles of the transformative paradigm. He also makes the point for readers that: 2768 The Qualitative Report 2024 Collaborating with community organisations and advocacy groups can enhance the social justice impact of transformative research. Working closely with these organisations ensures that research findings are relevant, actionable, and have a greater potential for transformative change. By aligning research goals with the priorities and needs of the communities being studied, researchers can strengthen the social justice outcomes of their work. Throughout the chapter he offers pertinent examples of how the transformative paradigm can be activated in research practice. Chapter 5 is entitled “Postcolonial Indigenous Paradigm and Methodological Alignment.” This chapter offers a crucial entry into the book, given the growing recognition of Indigenous perspectives in research. Omodan explains with fervor how this paradigm arose: Within the context of the historical and ongoing effects of colonialism on indigenous communities. It acknowledges and challenges the oppressive legacy of colonisation, recognising the profound social, cultural, political, and economic disruptions experienced by indigenous peoples worldwide.

It acknowledges and challenges the oppressive legacy of colonisation, recognising the profound social, cultural, political, and economic disruptions experienced by indigenous peoples worldwide. This paradigm seeks to reclaim indigenous identities, knowledge, and sovereignty while critiquing the dominant colonial narratives that have marginalised and eroded indigenous cultures (Chilisa & Phatshwane, 2022). (p. 119) This chapter emphasizes the importance of cultural sensitivity, and the ethical considerations involved in working with indigenous communities, as well as the ethical principles that can be adopted by all researchers wishing to decolonize the research process so that Western-styled ways of knowing do not dominate the research landscape. The chapter highlights the necessity of empowering marginalized voices and respecting indigenous rights. The options for aligning research questions with this paradigm, coupled with his account of Indigenous-focused ways of collecting/generating data and analyzing and interpreting them to serve Indigenous and marginalized communities across the globe, are well illustrated through his examples. At the same time, he touches on concerns with environmental justice issues as stressed by many Indigenous scholars. He summarizes that the strength of the paradigm is that it “emphasises the importance of engaging in respectful and reciprocal research relationships with indigenous communities, involving them as active participants in the research process and ensuring that research aligns with their needs, priorities, and values” (p 120). The richness of discussion in this chapter points to his familiarity with this way of doing research and of justifying its importance on the world stage (of research). As in the other chapters, Omodan is not shy from offering potential critiques that might help to further enrich research undertaken in terms of this paradigm. For example, he suggests that power imbalances between professional researchers and research participants still need to be carefully reflected upon in each case of the doing of research. This, he notes, requires researchers to give attention to developing “an understanding of the historical context of colonialism” (with its unbalanced and exploitative relations).

This, he notes, requires researchers to give attention to developing “an understanding of the historical context of colonialism” (with its unbalanced and exploitative relations). Undoing historically embedded colonization, including through processes of research, requires challenging colonial legacies. Researchers thus need to “continuously reflect on the transformative potential of their research, engaging with community members in co -creating knowledge and a ctively supporting Indigenous-led initiatives for decolonization” (pp. 140-141). Chapter 6 is entitled “Pragmatism Paradigm and Methodological Alignment.” In this chapter Omodan indicates that this paradigm “represents a unique philosophical stance that emphasises practical application [of knowing endeavors] contextual understanding, and the integration of thought and action” (146). He points to its origins in the late 19th century and Ana Inês Lourenço da Costa, Maria da Luz Jansénio Monteiro de Almeida Fonseca Rosa, 2769 and Paula Manuela Jorge Diogo indicates that as an approach to knowledge generation it has shaped various (research) fields, “challenging traditional dichotomies between [for instance] theory and practice, objectivity and subjectivity” (p. 149). He indicates that it is a living philoso phy and is likely to “continue evolving” (p. 148). As in other chapters, he delves deeply, with reference to various proponents’ arguments, into the philosophical foundations, including the complex interplay of epistemology, ontology, and axiology. As far as axiology is concerned, he indicates that a rejection of the “fact -value dichotomy is an integral aspect of the pragmatism paradigm”, which, he notes, posits that “facts and values are intertwined, shaping and influenced by one another” (p. 149). He elucidates the implications of this for the use of research as an approach to “inquiry in action”, guided by efforts to solve issues of concern (as identified in terms of certain values). In the chapter he also discusses how the pragmatic “problem-solving orientation” aligns with the efforts of those looking to employ mixed-methods research, in terms of a notion of the practicalities of aligning diverse data collection and analysis ", "source": "_Engaging with Paradigmatic Stances in Social Science Research__.pdf"}, {"id": 98, "text": "for the use of research as an approach to “inquiry in action”, guided by efforts to solve issues of concern (as identified in terms of certain values). In the chapter he also discusses how the pragmatic “problem-solving orientation” aligns with the efforts of those looking to employ mixed-methods research, in terms of a notion of the practicalities of aligning diverse data collection and analysis methods. He thus articulates how pragmatism as a philosophy has often be en a basis for those employing mixed methods, as a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. As he states, pragmatism “resonates profoundly with mixed methods research” (p. 154). As in other chapters, he offers examples of how research questions might be formulated within this paradigm. But in this case, he remarks that when crafting questions, one needs to “ensure that the inquiry is methodologically consistent and philosophically grounded” (p. 159). To guide readers as to how this may be done, he offers some examples. One example which he offers (as having a problem-centred focus and as thus compatible with a pragmatic position) is the following: Addressing Mental Health Issues in the Workplace: In a study focusing on mental health in the corporate environment, the researcher could ask: “What are the primary causes of stress and burnout among employees in high-pressure industries, and what interventions can be designed to alleviate these issues?” This question targets a real-world problem—work-related stress and burnout— and seeks to understand the causes and possible solutions. The goal is to generate knowledge that could lead to the development of practical interventions for improving mental well-being in the workplace. (p. 161) When I read this example, as well as some of Omodan’s other ones, I wondered if the focus on the “immediate” problem (of potential burnout) means that researchers do not adopt a more macro (and critical) perspective, which could enable people in the workplace and indeed the wider society to challenge discourses which focus on the mental health of individuals, while leaving intact the structuring of (capitalist) economies around the “productivity” of workers, in the attempt to generate increased corporate profits.

The narrow framing of the research question for me implies a narrowing down of meaningful discussion which would allow us to challenge dominant narratives circulating in the society. The idea of researching mental health of workers in a specific industry does not touch on the problem of the way in which work has become organized around the narrative of increasing productivity (which one can critically consider/reconstruct as worker exploi tation). Although some immediate “transformative” interventions may result from the narrow setting of the research question, the issue of who is setting it and whose interests it may serve are left in abeyance here. This is the argument offered by Hesse-Biber (2015) in her examination of pragmatism as a paradigm often used to justify the use of mixed method research (MMR). She avers that the kind of pragmatism supported by early philosophical pragmatists such as Dewey and colleagues has now “commonly reverted” to a stance where a research question is posed and whatever methods are seen as helping to answer it, become employed on “pragmatic” grounds. But she insists that we need to partake 2770 The Qualitative Report 2024 in more reflected -upon considerations as to “just how the research question enters into the MMR project.” She argues that this is for the most part “woefully unarticulated” (2015, p. 784). This is also the argument that Mertens has expressed in her various writings, in which she, along with Indigenous scholars, expresses a preference for the transformative and Indigenous paradigms to justify MMR (cf. Cram & Mertens, 2015). I wondered therefo re if Omodan’s chosen examples of the “pragmatic” idea of mixing methods to generate an understanding of reality for purposes of action, could have been used to point to more critical considerations around the setting of the research questions. Of course, Omodan does indicate that, as with all paradigms, it is important that researchers adopt a stance of reflexivity, which includes considering the likely consequences that the research endeavor may have in the society (for participants and wider audiences).

Of course, Omodan does indicate that, as with all paradigms, it is important that researchers adopt a stance of reflexivity, which includes considering the likely consequences that the research endeavor may have in the society (for participants and wider audiences). But I wondered if he should have brought this out more clearly through the examples that he offered in his discussion of pragmatism. Having said this, I did find his way of organizing the “methodological alignment” with principles of the paradigm to be a fair way of illustrating how indeed proponents of this paradigm might approach the research endeavor. And Omodan does also offer a sec tion discussing “critiques and debates” within the paradigm, indicating “tensions, challenges and dialogues that continue to shape its role and definition in contemporary research”. In this section, he points out that one critique (among others) is that it can lead to a “superficial understanding of phenomena” (p. 172). Another critique he offers is that the: Drive to provide immediate, practical solutions may lead researchers to bypass the complexities and nuances of a phenomenon in favour of more accessible but possibly superficial answers. In doing so, the rich theoretical insights and more profound understanding that often emerge from in -depth exploration might be neglected or undervalued. (p. 173) He states that debates such as the ones he is showcasing here “reflect the complex nature of research paradigms and the ongoing dialogues that shape and refine our understanding of knowledge and inquiry in various fields” (p. 174). He thus uses his discuss ion in this chapter, as in the others, to urge readers to enter the dialogues. Conclusion Overall, Omodan has put considerable thought into explaining the theoretical/philosophical foundations of different paradigms and how these have been, and can be, related to specific ways of doing research.

Some writers even hold that deﬁning a researcher’s own paradigm, i.e., including deﬁning their own ontology and epistemology, should be the starting point for conducting any qualitative project. Yet there appears to be little recognition of the uniqueness of the researcher- deﬁned paradigm model often promoted within qualitative research or the existence of alternative paradigm conceptions. Based on an analysis of the original texts, I compare the researcher-deﬁned paradigms proposed by Guba and Lincoln with paradigm conceptions proposed by Kuhn (1970) and Burrell and Morgan (1979), highlighting fundamental differences in their rationale, deﬁnition, who or what has a paradigm, how they arise, the positions that researchers can adopt, the scope of their ontological claims, their relation to speciﬁc research projects, examples of paradigm positions, and their tenets. The analysis shows that while the three sets of authors all refer to their constructions as paradigms, they present distinct, unrelated paradigm models. Recognizing the potential of distinct paradigm conceptions opens a space for qualitative researchers to reexamine their own commitments. Given the potential alternatives, qualitative researchers who continue to appeal to researcher-deﬁned paradigms at the very least should be able to justify both their choice of paradigm conception and the position they have chosen within it. That there are viable alternatives should allow qualitative researchers to reconsider whether the researcher-deﬁned paradigm model remains the best approach for presenting their assumptions related to a project. Keywords paradigms, Kuhn, assumptions, research methodology Introduction Paradigms are fundamental to some characterizations of qualitative research, helping to deﬁne both what qualitative research is and how it should be conducted (Blaikie & Priest, 2017; Creswell, 2013; Denzin and Lincoln, 2017; Guba and Lincoln, 2005; Lincoln & Egon, 1985; Lincoln et al., 2024).

There have been longstanding debates within the qualitative research community about which paradigm position to adopt (Guba, 1978, 1990) and whether paradigms continue to play a useful role within qualitative and mixed methods research (Donmoyer, 2006; Johnson, 2011; Maxwell, 2011). We have been through “paradigm wars” (Anderson and Herr, 1998; Gage, 1989; Given, 2017), calls for “paradigm dialogue” (Denzin, 2009), and concerns about the proliferation of par- adigm positions (Donmoyer, 2008). While debate about the role of paradigms within the qualitative research community appears to have gone quiet of late, appeals to paradigms continue to be regularly made by qualitative researchers (Alcala et al., 2022; Hu, 2022; Zinatsa & Saurombe, 2022) and have even moved online (Adu, 2021; Barrow, 2019). Almost all this discussion in the qualitative research lit- erature assumes a single paradigm conception, a conception I have referred to as the researcher-deﬁned paradigm model (Chafe, 2023). This conception was originally proposed by Guba and Lincoln (Guba, 1978, 1990; Guba & Lincoln, 1994).

Email: rogerch@mun.ca researcher-deﬁned paradigm model is the idea that a re- searcher needs to ﬁrst deﬁne their own ontology, which in- forms their selection of an epistemology, which informs the methodological choices for a study. In order to reconsider the basis of this model, in this article Iﬁrst offer a deﬁnition of what a paradigm conception is and propose some terminology for discussing their features. I then compare Guba and Lin- coln’s researcher-deﬁned conception with two alternative paradigm conceptions:Kuhn (1970)and Burrell and Morgan (1979). These authors all refer to their conceptions as para- digms. To help avoid confusion I will refer to their positions using the following descriptors: discipline paradigms (Kuhn) and positional paradigm (Burrell and Morgan). The basis for these descriptors will be clear after the discussion of each conception below. A comparison of these alternatives will highlight the unique features of the researcher-deﬁned con- ception. While they all discuss assumptions that underlie some type of inquiry, there are profound differences in the type of assumptions these authors discuss and in what they aim to achieve with their different paradigms. These three examples are not the only conceptions of paradigms that have been proposed, even within the qualitative research tradition (Ford, 1975; Guba & Lincoln, 1982; Patton, 1980), but these models illustrate the possibility for various paradigm conceptions and the scope of difference between them. I conclude by dis- cussing the implications alternative paradigm conceptions have for current qualitative researchers. Although it is based on an analysis of older works, the article is not just a historical account of other paths we could have taken. It also aims to defamiliarize the conception of a paradigm used within qualitative research.

It also aims to defamiliarize the conception of a paradigm used within qualitative research. Highlighting a variety of paradigm conceptions hopefully opens a space for current qualitative researchers to reexamine their own commitments. Approach This article arose from a program of research examining different models of qualitative inquiry. In reviewing earlier qualitative texts, I identiﬁed that Guba says his paradigms arose from the work of several sources (e.g., Ford, 1975; Hesse, 1980; Schwartz & Ogilvy, 1979), but also from the work of Kuhn (Guba, 1978; Guba & Lincoln, 1985). This claim is repeated by later qualitative researchers (e.g.,Thorne, 2016: 44). But in reviewing Guba’s early work, I realized that he does not provide any substantive analysis of Kuhn’s po- sition. In fact, he barely even directly references it. In re- viewing Kuhn’s work (1970), it became apparent that the authors clearly provide very distinct conceptions of what a paradigm is. During this review, I also identiﬁed other par- adigm conceptions authors proposed in relation to academic inquiry (Patton, 1975; 1980; Ford, 1975) and that some au- thors can be seen as presenting multiple distinct paradigm models (Guba & Lincoln, 1982). The term paradigmata dates back to Plato, in whose work it refers to an exemplary example of something (Ambuel, 2007; Merton, 2004; Weiss, 2012). Its reintroduction into modern academic discussions comes from at least three sources. In his 1930s lectures, Wittgenstein uses paradigm to refer to the reference examples (or“yardsticks”) which he sees as being required for shared language games ( Luckhardt, 1978 ; Wittgenstein, 1972). In this way, Wittgenstein uses the term in a way similar to Plato. Paradigms have been used indepen- dently in linguistics to describe certain structures of language (Fossali et al., 2017; Saussure, 2006). The idea of a paradigm relating to the underlying assumptions of a position or theory was ﬁrst raised byMerton (1973, 1996, 2004) in the 1940s. Merton’s paradigms are schema used for presenting the un- derlying assumptions, concepts, and remaining questions re- lated to a theory or position. In particular, Merton saw value in detailing the conceptual assumptions inherent in qualitative descriptions, but he also developed paradigms for entire dis- ciplines, e.g., sociology (Merton, 1973; Merton, 20", "source": "chafe-2024-different-paradigm-conceptions-and-their-implications-for-qualitative-research.pdf"}, {"id": 107, "text": "byMerton (1973, 1996, 2004) in the 1940s. Merton’s paradigms are schema used for presenting the un- derlying assumptions, concepts, and remaining questions re- lated to a theory or position. In particular, Merton saw value in detailing the conceptual assumptions inherent in qualitative descriptions, but he also developed paradigms for entire dis- ciplines, e.g., sociology (Merton, 1973; Merton, 2004:2 6 8 ) . Later authors introduce talk of paradigms as being the worldview of either an individual person or culture (Ford, 1975; Schwartz & Ogilvy, 1979). For example,Schwartz and Ogilvy (1979:3 )s e eap a r a d i g ma sb e i n g“the abstract level” between or the lens through which an individual sees the actual world. For the analysis presented below, I focused on three paradigm conceptions, which I de ﬁne as paradigm models that identify various positions that can be adopted within them. I chose Kuhn and Guba and Lincoln’s conceptions because of their importance to qualitative research and the presumed connection between them. Burrell and Morgan’s conception was developed around the same time as Guba and Lincoln’s conception and highlights another alternative with a similar structure. As these authors all present various formulations of their paradigms, I focused this analysis on what I took to be their earliest deﬁnitive formulation:Kuhn (1970), Burrell and Morgan (1979), and Guba and Lincoln (1994). Paradigm conceptions are complex and they have many features in terms of which they can be compared. Based on what seemed to be the most signiﬁcant differences between the three conceptions, I selected nine features to focus on: the rationale for developing their paradigm model, i.e., what is the model meant to do; how are different paradigm positions deﬁned; who or what has a paradigm; what is the origin of different paradigm positions, i.e., how do they arise or get adopted; what is the scope of their ontological claims; their proposed connection to research projects; what is the range of paradigm positions that could be adopted within a conception; and the types of assumptions or tenets that can be included in a paradigm position. Other points of comparison could also have been examined, but these features are sufﬁcient to il- lustrate the distinctness of the various conceptions.

Other points of comparison could also have been examined, but these features are sufﬁcient to il- lustrate the distinctness of the various conceptions. The Structure of a Paradigm Conception To better understand different paradigm conceptions, it is useful toﬁrst recognize the different levels at which they can be discussed ( Table 1 ). Paradigms specifying separate 2 International Journal of Qualitative Methods positions have three distinct levels. The highest level is the conception of a paradigm itself, which is the broad concept of a paradigm that an author presents. For example, as we will see, Kuhn and Guba and Lincoln offer unique conceptions of what is a paradigm. It may be useful to think of a conception of a paradigm then as setting up its own system or game. A vital step for better understanding paradigms is being clear about which conception is being discussed, i.e., which game are you in. The second level concerns the different positions that can be taken up under a conception of a paradigm. For example, Guba & Lincoln, 1994conception describes four paradigm positions that can be taken up: positivism, post-positivism, critical theory, and constructivism. This is the level at which paradigm positions get adopted by different researchers. While Guba and Lincoln present a conception of a paradigm, they do not attempt to differentiate researchers at the level of their general conception. Rather they see researchers as being differentiated by whether they are a positivist, constructivist, etc., i.e., by the paradigm position they hold. Authors have produced a long list of the types of items and assumptions that they have included in their paradigm positions, e.g., philo- sophical suppositions, theories, artifacts, etc. I propose the general term “tenets” to refer to the beliefs, positions, as- sumptions, or any other items that can make up a paradigm position. Paradigm positions are made up of multiple tenets. On the lowest of the three structural levels of a paradigm conception, discussions could be about a speciﬁc tenet of a paradigm position, again recognizing that relevant tenets are deﬁned in reference to a speciﬁc conception of a paradigm. Within Guba and Lincoln’s conception, na¨", "source": "chafe-2024-different-paradigm-conceptions-and-their-implications-for-qualitative-research.pdf"}, {"id": 109, "text": "sumptions, or any other items that can make up a paradigm position.

On the lowest of the three structural levels of a paradigm conception, discussions could be about a speciﬁc tenet of a paradigm position, again recognizing that relevant tenets are deﬁned in reference to a speciﬁc conception of a paradigm. Within Guba and Lincoln’s conception, na¨ıve realism is a tenet of a positivist position. Even within a paradigm position, we could debate what should be included in a tenet, e.g., what counts as a na¨ıve realist position? A conception of a paradigm deﬁnes the characteristics of the paradigm positions that can be taken up under it. In other words, each conception deﬁnes the type of tenets that its paradigm positions must have. Guba & Lincoln, 1994 conception proposes that their paradigm positions must have, or can be distinguished by, their ontology, epistemology, and methodology (Guba & Lincoln, 1994 ). Furthermore, the paradigm positions under different conceptions are deﬁned differently and have no direct reference to each other. Al- though they may look similar, paradigm positions within different conceptions may be best seen as teams in different sports. One way to distinguish two conceptions of a paradigm then is to compare the characteristics they use to deﬁne their paradigm positions. If two conceptions identify different te- nets that their paradigm positions must have, then they should be considered distinct conceptions. This three-level paradigm structure will become more apparent once we apply it to different paradigm conceptions below. Kuhn’s Discipline Paradigms Kuhn presents a“historically oriented view of science,” which includes the idea that communities of scientists, particularly in the natural sciences, often work under a shared set of basic assumptions about the nature of their tasks (Kuhn, 1970: x). This shared conception includes ideas about what constitutes important questions for scientists to work on and what are seen as legitimate methods and instruments for scientists to employ. The fundamental beliefs that a group of scientists share during a period which allows for the practice of“normal science” would constitute a paradigm position under Kuhn’s concep- tion.

The fundamental beliefs that a group of scientists share during a period which allows for the practice of“normal science” would constitute a paradigm position under Kuhn’s concep- tion. Kuhn’s concept of normal science, which encompasses the activities natural scientists mostly do, refers to the work focused on solving the problems and puzzles that arise from a paradigm position. For example, in the late 1900s, many scientists proposed that light travels through ether. Belief in this possibility set about numerous experiments trying to demonstrate its existence. The wide acceptance of Einstein’s work by the 1920s, which rejected the existence of ether, made most of that previous work irrelevant, but created a new set of problems and puzzles for scientists to work on (Isaacson, 2007; Kuhn, 1970). Table 1. Levels of Paradigm Discussion. Term De ﬁnition Example Conception of a paradigm The broad concept of a paradigm that an author presents. It will deﬁne the different positions that can be adopted under it, including specifying the type of tenets that describe distinct paradigm positions within this conception. The conception of a paradigm also deﬁnes who or what can hold a paradigm position Guba and Lincoln (1994)present a conception of a paradigm in which the paradigm positions must have the following type of tenets: An ontology, an epistemology, and a methodology Paradigm positions The positions that can be held within and are deﬁned by a speciﬁc conception of a paradigm. They are made up of sets of tenets (i.e., assumptions, beliefs, etc.). Which tenets get deﬁned for a paradigm position is determined by the conception of a paradigm it is under One of the paradigm positionsGuba and Lincoln (1994) identify is positivism.

They are also almost completely held by scientists working on the same topic at the same time. For example, there are no well-regarded contemporary scientists who are still conducting experi- m e n t st r y i n gt ol o c a t ee t h e r .E v e ni ft h e r ew e r e ,t h e i rw o r k would likely not be seen as useful or legitimate science by other contemporary scientists. It is often historians who are best placed to describe the paradigm positions of an age or scientiﬁc community. With that said, Kuhn’s paradigms do not constitute a “metaphysical worldview ” (Masterman, 1970: 59). Paradigms are conﬁn e dt od i r e c t i n gt h ew o r k - ing of a scientiﬁc discipline at a certain point in time. Key for Kuhn’s conception of science is that these shared sets of basic assumptions change over time, leading to profound dis- ruptions to the way science is conducted. Rather than the natural sciences being a steady accumulation of discoveries, there are historical shifts in what are seen as important facts and signiﬁcant scientiﬁc questions to pursue. Kuhn calls these changes “scientiﬁc revolutions” (e.g., as illustrated in the change for scientists working within the con ﬁnes of Newtonian physics adopting Einstein’s theory of relativity). It is not just that a new theory is adopted, but that there is a shift in the entire set of tasks that scientists see as needing to be worked on. For Kuhn, key to understanding how the natural sciences work is to recognize this interplay between periods of normal science and the profound disruptions to them. Because a paradigm position forms the basis of the tasks scientists are working on, i t cannot itself be determined scientiﬁcally. Kuhn says that“[o]bservation and experience can and must drastically restrict the range of admissible scientiﬁc belief, else there would be no science.

An apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal and historical accident, is always a formative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scientiﬁcc o m m u n i t ya tag i v e n time” (Kuhn, 1970: 4). The ability to develop shared sets of beliefs about the nature of their tasks, i.e., to have a paradigm position, is something Kuhn sees occurring throughout history for communities of natural scientists. Evidence that a new paradigm position has arisen for the study of a topic can often be seen by examining the textbooks, scienti ﬁc equipment, and the academic journals used by a community of scientists. Kuhn holds that communities of social scien- tists, who are more likely to have“overt disagreements… about the nature of legitimate scienti ﬁc problems and methods,” have mostly not had paradigm positions under his conception of a paradigm (Kuhn, 1970: viii). In fact, one of the events that led Kuhn to develop his conception of a paradigm was working with social scientists and recognizing their inability to agree on the fundamental direction of their work (Kuhn, 1970: viii). Burrell and Morgan’s Positional Paradigm Burrell and Morgan (1979:1) hold that“[a]ll social scientists approach their subject via explicit or implicit assumptions about the nature of the social world and the way in which it may be investigated.” They propose a framework for mapping social theories or social theorists along two dimensions. The ﬁrst dimension relates to assumptions about the way the social world may be investigated, i.e., different philosophies of the social sciences. To conceptualize the differences in these philosophies, Burrell and Morgan propose a scale for theorists from having subjectivist to objectivist positions. To identify where on the scale theorists are, they propose focusing on four types of assumptions theorists make: ontological assumptions, epistemological assumptions, views of human nature, and methodological assumptions. The subjective side of these positions would hold a nominalist ontology (i.e., the view that social structures exist only in th", "source": "chafe-2024-different-paradigm-conceptions-and-their-implications-for-qualitative-research.pdf"}, {"id": 113, "text": "from having subjectivist to objectivist positions.

The subjective side of these positions would hold a nominalist ontology (i.e., the view that social structures exist only in the minds of individuals), an anti-positivist epistemology (i.e., the rejection of there being “underlying regularities in the world of social affairs”), a voluntarism view of human nature (i.e., that people are “completely autonomous and free-willed ”), and an ideo- graphic methodology (i.e., a methodology focused on“sub- jective accounts” (Burrell & Morgan, 1979: 6)). They see the subjectivist view of the social sciences as being in line with the German idealist tradition, including Hegel and Marx. The objectivist view would hold the opposite positions and would align more with the sociological positivist tradition. The views of most social theorists would fall somewhere between the extreme subjectivist or objectivist poles. The other main dimension for their framework regards theories of societies, with the scale ranging from a sociology of radical change to a sociology of regulation and social stability. Where theorists sit on this scale depends on their concern re- garding seven features of societies, e.g., status quo versus radical change, social order versus structural conﬂict, actuality versus potentiality, etc. Using their two main dimensions, Burrell and Morgan identify four paradigm positions in which most social theories and social theorists can be located (Figure 1 is recreated from Burrell & Morgan, 1979:2 2 ) .P a r a d i g m positions are deﬁned using the four possible binary combina- tions of the polls of the two dimensions. For example, radical humanists hold to a subjective philosophy of the social sciences and are focused on the sociology of radical change. These four possible paradigm positions– which they call radical humanist, radical structuralist, interpretive and functionalist - make up a shared framework for better understanding and describing the positions of various social theorists vis-`a-vis each other.

These four possible paradigm positions– which they call radical humanist, radical structuralist, interpretive and functionalist - make up a shared framework for better understanding and describing the positions of various social theorists vis-`a-vis each other. Within Burrell and Morgan’s conception, paradigm posi- tions are major categories representing“fundamentally dif- ferent perspectives for the analysis of social phenomena” (Burrell & Morgan, 1979: 23). They are sets of“very basic meta-theoretical assumptions ” which likely help underlie different social theories (Burrell & Morgan, 1979: 23). They should be seen as“analytically distinct” (Burrell & Morgan, 4 International Journal of Qualitative Methods 1979: 7), so that the paradigms in the framework are mutually exclusive of each other, which likely helps serve their role as a “classiﬁcatory device” (Burrell & Morgan, 1979: 8). Because they are mutually exclusive, a theorist cannot adopt two paradigms at the same time. It is possible for theorists to change their paradigm, but it is rare because it would represent a fundamental break in how they approach social theory. Burrell and Morgan point to the apparent differences in the perspectives and interests of a young Karl Marx to that shown in his later writings as one potential example of a paradigm shift within their framework. While their selection is informed by the history of social thought, the dimensions are chosen, and the paradigm positions themselves do not arise from the activities of social theorists. That they do not arise from the actions of actual researchers is a way that these paradigms differ from Kuhn’s paradigms. Rather they are abstract architypes which serve as a reference for better understanding the basic as- sumptions associated with a speciﬁc social theory. Within this framework, there will always be the same four paradigm po- sitions regardless of what communities of social theorists do. Taken together, Burrell and Morgan see their four- paradigm framework as“an extremely powerful tool for the analysis of social theory” (Burrell & Morgan, 1979:7 )a n d“a convenient means of identifying the basic similarities and differences between the work of various theorists” (Burrell & Morgan, 1979: 23).

Much of the power of their framework comes from taking these four paradigm positions together and contrasting the positions of theorists against them. While there is enough commonality to say that they are working within the same general approach, especially when compared to theorists working under other paradigm positions,“within the context of any given paradigm there will be much debate between theorists who adopt different standpoints”(Burrell & Morgan, 1979:2 3 ) . We can perhaps think of Burrell and Morgan’sf o u rp a r a d i g m framework then as a tool for locating some of the important “overt disagreements” over fundamentals, the kind of dis- agreements which led Kuhn to conclude that paradigms under his conception are difﬁcult for social scientists to achieve. Guba and Lincoln’s Researcher-Deﬁned Paradigm The paradigms most familiar to qualitative researchers were ﬁrst developed byGuba (1978)and Lincoln and Egon (1985). In the 1970s, they and other authors initially began talking about paradigms to highlight differences between naturalistic inquiry and research approaches that favored more variable- focused, experimental models of educational research (Guba, 1978; Guba & Lincoln, 1982; Patton, 1975). Their identiﬁ- cation of distinct paradigm positions is, however, more than a “classiﬁcatory device.” While there is an expository aspect, there is also a clear argument for naturalistic inquiry in their presentation (Chafe, 2023; Guba, 1978). Advocating for a particular position contrasts with the apparently more neutral intent of Morgan and Burrell’s four paradigm framework. Identifying naturalistic inquiry as a distinct paradigm position also demarks it, and later theﬁeld of qualitative research, so that it could not be simply incorporated back into more tra- ditional research approaches (Donmoyer, 2006; Patton, 1980). Guba and Lincoln use the term paradigm in numerous and sometimes conﬂicting ways. They talk about a research ap- proach being a paradigm position. For example, they say that “[N]aturalistic inquiry is a paradigm of inquiry, that is, a pattern or model for how inquiry may be ", "source": "chafe-2024-different-paradigm-conceptions-and-their-implications-for-qualitative-research.pdf"}, {"id": 116, "text": "so that it could not be simply incorporated back into more tra- ditional research approaches (Donmoyer, 2006; Patton, 1980).

For example, they say that “[N]aturalistic inquiry is a paradigm of inquiry, that is, a pattern or model for how inquiry may be conducted” (Guba & Lincoln, 1982: 233). Guba (1978) also says that a form of inquiry, e.g., ethnography, can be“the precursor and para- digm” for another type of inquiry, e.g., naturalistic inquiry. Moving away from describing it as a type of inquiry, Lincoln and Guba (1985: 15) relate paradigms with fundamental views about the world, i.e., that“[p]aradigms represent a distillation of what we think about the world (but cannot prove).” Par- adigms are also said to reﬂect a researcher’s thoughts about their speciﬁc subject matter, i.e., that they are “axiomatic systems characterized essentially by their differing sets of assumptions about the phenomena into which they are de- signed to inquire” (Guba & Lincoln, 1982: 233), which seems to echo Merton’s paradigm as a schema of assumptions. Guba and Lincoln’s perhaps best-known conception of a paradigm is presented in their articleCompeting paradigms in qualitative research(Guba & Lincoln, 1994). This article has been identi ﬁed as a key reference in many qualitative methodological texts (Creswell, 2013; Leavy, 2014) and has been cited over 30,000 times (Google Scholar, 2024). In this article, Guba and Lincoln say that“a paradigm may be viewed as a set of basic beliefs (or metaphysics) that deal with ulti- mates orﬁrst principles. It represents a worldview that deﬁnes, for its holder, the nature of the“world,” the individual’s place in it, and the range of possible relationships to that world and Figure 1.

The beliefs are basic in the sense that they must be accepted simply on faith” (Guba & Lincoln, 1994: 107). Their conception incorporates two elements introduced by Ford (1975) in her unorthodox bookParadigms and Fairy Tales. Ford presents the idea that everyone has “thought paradigms,” which are the ways that both experts and“or- dinary people in their everyday lives” construct an account of reality. These thought paradigms are described as consisting “of thoughts wrapped up in thoughts about thoughts” (Ford, 1975: 2). Ford’s intention is to reduce all scientiﬁc theories and mental constructions, including the work of the natural and social sciences, to the status of fairy tales that a person tells themselves (Perman, 1976). Following Ford, Guba and Lincoln (1985: 15) hold that a paradigm is something held by an in- dividual person or researcher. In other words, theirs are not discipline paradigms. Guba and Lincoln also follow Ford in basing their paradigms on a metaphysical worldview, which Ford refers to as“BASIC BELIEFS.” These beliefs“are our most fundamental thoughts about the ultimate nature, or‘es- sence” of things. They are what philosophers sometimes call ontological assumptions”(Ford, 1975: 16). This commitment to ontological foundationalism clearly separates Guba and Lin- coln’s conception from Kuhn’s characterization of a paradigm (Kuhn, 1970; Masterman, 1970: 59). As Guba and Lincoln’s claims focus on all reality, their ontological claims can be distinguished also from Burrell and Morgan’sp o s i t i o n a lp a r - adigm, which is limited to theories about the social world. Another unique feature of Guba and Lincoln’s position is their claim about how paradigm positions should be used in research. They hold that paradigm positions are“the starting points or givens that determine what inquiry is and how it is to be practiced” (Guba, 1990: 18); and as such, that researchers need to clarify their paradigm position at the beginning of the research process (Creswell, 2013:17; Denzin et al., 2024: 20- 21; Denzin and Lincoln, 2017:1 1–15). Including paradigm deﬁnition within the process for conducting a research project is not found in either Kuhn or Burrell and Morgan. In fact, for Kuhn, scientists may not even appreciate the paradigm that they are working under.

Including paradigm deﬁnition within the process for conducting a research project is not found in either Kuhn or Burrell and Morgan. In fact, for Kuhn, scientists may not even appreciate the paradigm that they are working under. Given their conception of a paradigm as a worldview that includes basic philosophical suppositions, it seems that Guba and Lincoln are asking individual re- searchers to layout their entire personal philosophical position or worldview before they can start a research project. A key innovation of the research-de ﬁned paradigm model over the years is the expansion in the number of paradigm positions identiﬁed (Lincoln et al., 2024). Their character- ization of these paradigm positions shares elements with both Kuhn and Burrell and Morgan. Like Burrell and Morgan, Guba and Lincoln’s categorization uses ﬁxed elements to classify paradigm positions. For Burrell and Morgan, it is theorists’philosophies of the social sciences and their theories of society which categorize different paradigm positions. Guba and Lincoln deﬁne paradigm positions using a re- searcher’s ontology, epistemology and methodology views. Like Kuhn, the four paradigm positions which Guba and Lincoln identify are contingent formulations and reﬂect par- adigm positions which communities of researchers appear to have adopted at a speciﬁc point in history. There is nothing necessary about selecting any of these positions. If the practice of inquiry changed over time, it may make sense to highlight alternative paradigm positions, which they do over different versions of their paradigm conception (Lincoln et al., 2024). There are, however, important differences between Guba and Lincoln’s and the other author’s positions. Burrell and Morgan’s paradigms reference a shared subject matter, i.e., theories of society, and therefore their model can illustrate “basic similarities and differences between the work of various theorists” (Burrell & Morgan, 1979: 23). Similarly for Kuhn, paradigm positions always refer to a speciﬁc subject matter and are limited to the beliefs that a community of scientists hold that allow for normal science to occur about that subject. Guba and Lincoln’s paradigm positions reﬂect views effecting inquiry generally, but they are not limited or deﬁned in rela", "source": "chafe-2024-different-paradigm-conceptions-and-their-implications-for-qualitative-research.pdf"}, {"id": 119, "text": "es between the work of various theorists” (Burrell & Morgan, 1979: 23). Similarly for Kuhn, paradigm positions always refer to a speciﬁc subject matter and are limited to the beliefs that a community of scientists hold that allow for normal science to occur about that subject. Guba and Lincoln’s paradigm positions reﬂect views effecting inquiry generally, but they are not limited or deﬁned in relation to any speciﬁc subject area beyond a person’s overall picture of reality. Even compared to the dimension of Burrell and Morgan’s model focused on the theorist’s philosophy of the social sciences, Guba and Lincoln expand their paradigm positions both in scope, e.g., a view of the social sciences versus a worldview; and in who has a paradigm, e.g., from social theorists to every researcher, and may be perhaps to every person (Ford, 1975; Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Schwartz & Ogilvy, 1979). Unlike Burrell and Morgan’s paradigms, these paradigms are not deﬁned such that they are mutually ex- clusive of each other, to be used as a complete set of potential paradigm positions; rather the paradigm positions that Guba and Lincoln identify are just four prominent positions out of many possible positions, which they expand on over the years. Guba and Lincoln’s paradigms also raise issues for sci- entists who hold different paradigm positions but work on the same topic. If methodology is ultimately based on an indi- vidual’s view of their reality, it is not clear what we can do to come together on a shared fairy tale. The best communities of researchers on a speciﬁc topic can do is for everyone to be explicit about their own paradigm positions and hope that some researchers, when faced with fellow researchers’ con- ﬂicting paradigm positions, are willing to change their worldviews. Guba and Lincoln suggest such convergences are possible through the creation of new paradigm positions (Guba & Lincoln, 1994: 116). But if we take Guba and Lincoln’s individually-focused ontological foundationalism seriously, for this conversion to occur, it requires that re- searchers not only change their view of how to study a topic. It requires that they change their basic beliefs, i.e., their“most fundamental thoughts about the ultimate nature, or essence of things” (Ford, 1975: 2). Given that these basic beliefs are ultimates that are only accepted on faith, it is not clear the mechanism throu", "source": "chafe-2024-different-paradigm-conceptions-and-their-implications-for-qualitative-research.pdf"}, {"id": 120, "text": "ionalism seriously, for this conversion to occur, it requires that re- searchers not only change their view of how to study a topic.

Given that these basic beliefs are ultimates that are only accepted on faith, it is not clear the mechanism through which they see these conversions oc- curring, although they do imply that socialization with re- searchers who hold divergent positions can play a role. Nor do 6 International Journal of Qualitative Methods Guba and Lincoln discuss how dramatic such conversions would be for the researchers who underwent one. Burrell and Morgan point out, it is rare for a social theorist to change their view of society over their career. But because they work at a more fundamental level, conversions of a person’s view of reality would appear to have even more consequences and bigger disruptions for a researcher. Something akin to the dramatic paradigm shifts that Kuhn located within scientiﬁc disciplines over time would, for Guba and Lincoln, seem to have to occur at the level of the individual researcher for them to take on a new paradigm. Similarly, it would seem to follow, that such a conversion could even make much of their previous work irrelevant to the researcher themselves, as it would have been developed under a different view of reality. Because on the researcher-deﬁned paradigm model it is the researcher’so n - tology that directs their choice of methodology, researchers also seem to be restricted from somehow suspending their onto- logical beliefs to choose a shared methodology to work with someone who held a different paradigm position from them. Comparing Conceptions of a Paradigm The authors had different rationales for proposing their par- adigm conception, which resulted in their different deﬁnitions of what a paradigm is. Kuhn wants to describe the workings of the natural sciences. In particular, he presents a new model of how both normal science and scientiﬁc revolutions occur. Burrell and Morgan aim to provide a framework for under- standing the positions of social theorists.

For Guba and Lincoln, the paradigms are the starting point that determine the direction of inquiry and their initial characterizations are presented as an argument for more naturalistic approaches. In terms of deﬁnition, for Kuhn, a paradigm position is a set of assumptions shared by scientists working in the sameﬁeld which allows for normal science to occur. For Burrell and Morgan, paradigm positions are sets of assumptions which can help identify major differences in the positions of social theorists. Guba and Lincoln see paradigm positionsas the basic belief system or worldviews that guide a researcher. These differences lead to unique answers to the questions: who or what has a paradigm and how do they arise? For Kuhn, it is scientiﬁc communities that hold paradigm positions, with positions being somewhat contingently developed, but with aﬁrm empirical element. For Burrell and Morgan, paradigm positions are basic binary choices in how social theorists approach the study of society. For Guba and Lincoln, a paradigm position is a worldview which the researcher holds that must be“accepted on faith.” Conceptions of paradigms can also differ concerning how explicit researchers should be about their paradigm positions and how to identify when one is achieved. For Kuhn, scientists are often not aware of their paradigmatic assumptions and sometimes it takes historians to identify the features of the position that a community of researchers held. For Burrell and Morgan, the paradigm a theorist has can be identiﬁed by analyzing their approach to their work. For Guba and Lincoln, paradigm positions relate to the individual researcher ’s worldview. It is only the individual researcher who knows their worldview, so they should be reﬂexive and explicit about the paradigmatic assumptions they hold. Another important consideration is the scope of the tenets that they include in a paradigm position. For Kuhn, paradigm positions extend to the shared beliefs held by scientists which allow for normal science to occur.Masterman (1970)identiﬁes Kuhn using three main categories or senses of the term paradigm related to its scope.

The second is sociological, which refers to the shared practices of a community of researchers. The third category is artefacts, which would include the textbooks and other instruments used by a scientiﬁc community. Burrell and Morgan limit their paradigm positions to the underlying as- sumptions of a social theorist, limiting their ontology concerns to theorists’ conception of the social world. Guba and Lin- coln’s conception extends paradigm positions to include the metaphysical worldview of a researcher.Table 2summarizes these key dimensions across the three paradigm conceptions. Discussion Merton famously introduced the idea of“obliteration by in- corporation” to identify cases when a term, idea, concept or ﬁnding is so widely discussed or accepted that people forget its origins (Merton, 1968). The case can be made that this type of obliteration has to some degree taken place regarding para- digms within qualitative research. Most of the last two gen- erations of researchers likely have learned that paradigms are just part of what qualitative research is; and there seems to have been little recognition of the range of paradigm char- acterizations available. In this article, I compared three early paradigm conceptions, showing that they represent very different conceptions of what a paradigm can be and how they can be structured. The use of paradigms within qualitative research has clearly evolved since Guba and Lincoln’s original competing paradigm article (1994), but even looking at these early examples highlights some of the choices qualitative researchers could make in structuring a paradigm conception. Guba (1990)said that there were advantages to leaving the idea of a paradigm in“a problematic limbo” by not deﬁning it and letting the concept evolve. He made that statement over 30 years ago.

Given the range of potential meanings, features they can have, the potential for confusion, and that it is a core concept in some conceptions of qualitative research, it is time to reconsider and clarify the structure and rationale for researcher-deﬁned paradigms within qualitative research. Many of these issues were never settled by Guba and Lincoln. For example, are paradigms meant to identify assumptions or a schema for classifying different approaches to research? Or do paradigms play a role in directing all the research projects a researcher works on, so that if they worked under another Chafe 7 paradigm their entire program of research could be irrecon- cilably different, similar to going through a Kuhnian revo- lution? Are paradigms something every person has, something just researchers or social theorists can hold, or are they something shared only by communities of researchers working on the same topic? If paradigms are our individual perspective on the world (Ford, 1975) and that this perspective determines how you should conduct research, where do these paradigms come from and do these basic beliefs evolve over time? Can individuals adopt any paradigm position they want? How do the paradigm conceptions adopted affect qualitatively driven mixed method designs (Morse & Cheek, 2015)? Some of the complexities with these research designs seem only to arise because of the adoption of the researcher-deﬁned par- adigm model and would likely not be problematic if we constructed other paradigm conceptions. Even the question whether all research projects require explicitly deﬁning a paradigm position; and if so, is this position something each individual researcher needs to deﬁne for themselves or can a shared paradigm be agreed to by the team, maybe even just for a single project, should be explicitly addressed? In short, there are many questions that researchers who want to continue to appeal to paradigms within qualitative research should meaningfully explore and decide on.

As an applied qualitative researcher who often works with multidisciplinary teams with various degrees of research ex- perience, I have often found that discussing potential paradigms and ontological positions the team could adopt as not being that useful, particularly if these claims are meant to extend to competing visions of reality each person may have. Guba’s conception of researcher-deﬁned paradigms arose as a way to separate naturalistic inquirers from researchers using more experimental approaches (Chafe, 2023; Guba, 1978). The conception was not proposed to help address any issues in actually conducting qualitative or mixed-methods research or to make it easier to work in multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder teams. In reconsidering paradigms within qualitative research, I see value in moving away from talking about paradigms al- together or adopting a conception more as a classiﬁcation device for comparing the underlying assumptions of general research approaches, rather than the worldviews of individual researchers. I would also highlight positionality statements (Bourke, 2014) and conceptual schemes (Maxwell, 2013; Miles & Huberman, 1994; Ravitch & Riggan, 2017)a sb e t t e rw a y st o situate individual projects than requiring research teams to come to an agreement on one of the paradigm positions cur- rently on offer.

This article does have some potential limitations. It is limited to only the analysis of three proposed conceptions of a paradigm, all three of which were published at least three decades ago. The comparison of paradigms was mostly limited to only nine features which were selected by the author. While it was focused on the different models in published texts and is supported by quotes, the analysis was also only carried out by one author. There is also some novel terminology presented in the article which will be new to some readers. Conclusion Paradigms have been central to some conceptions of quali- tative research. This analysis illustrates that there are various paradigm conceptions we can adopt. It raises the question of whether the model of researcher-deﬁned paradigms, which are meant to capture a researcher’s worldview, best reﬂects the needs of current qualitative researchers. As a fundamental part of qualitative research for the last 50 years, our research community should welcome these types of discussions and hopefully greater clarity that will come with them. Most of what I have discussed relates to understanding conceptions of a paradigm, but the conception adopted has direct implications for the paradigm positions one takes. The model adopted will also impact the assumptions to which a researcher will attend. At the very least, authors defending their paradigm position should be able both to justify the conception of a paradigm they have chosen and the paradigm position they have chosen under it. I recognize that this may require more effort, but it seems necessary in order to talk about paradigms more knowledgeably. We should also continue to explore alterna- tive approaches for qualitative researchers to present their assumptions related to speciﬁc projects.

Keywords: research paradigms, ontology, epistemology, axiology, methodology Introduction A sound methodological design is not merely a technical requirement but the backbone of any successful research project, influencing every stage from data collection to analysis and interpretation. In the humanities and social sciences, this process requires researchers to not only select appropriate methods but also articulate the philosophical foundations that guide their inquiry. These foundations, encapsulated in what is known as a “ research paradigm ,” serve as a lens through which the researcher views the world, impacting their understanding of reality (ontology), their beliefs about how knowledge is generated (epistemology), and their stance on the role of values in research (axiology). The challenge, however, lies in effectively communicating these abstract concepts. Ontology, epistemology, and axiology can be difficult to grasp, especia lly since they are interpreted differently depending on the researcher’s perspective. This complexity often leads to oversimplifications or omissions in research methodology discussions, resulting in a lack of clarity for novice researchers and those attempting to engage more deeply with these philosophical underpinnings. Compounding this challenge is the scarcity of accessible introductory materials that offer clear overviews of the various research paradigms. Researchers frequently turn to general methodology texts or complex philosophical treatises (some commonly used sources include Bryman, 2016; Creswell & Creswell, 2018; Crotty, 1998; Lincoln & Guba, 2016). This gap in the literature inspired me to write a blog post in early 2024 aimed at demystifying the most Lynette Pretorius 2699 common research paradigms for my students. I also developed a series of videos covering the basics of the most common research paradigms.

The purpose of this article is to provide an introductory overview of the most common research paradigms: positivism, post- positivism, constructivism, social constructionism, interpretivism, pragmatism, and critical realism, each of which shapes how resear chers understand reality, generate knowledge, and integrate values into their work. All these paradigms can be used in qualitative research, though it is important to note that positivism and post-positivism are more frequently seen in quantitative researc h. This article aims to guide researchers in identifying which paradigm best aligns with their worldview. As this article is designed as a practical tool for novice researchers, each paradigm overview is accompanied by suggestions for further reading. In this way, readers can then pursue a more detailed understanding by engaging with the complex philosophical discussions that underpin their chosen paradigms. What Is a Research Paradigm? A research paradigm explains what the researcher believes reality is, how they think knowledge can be understood, and what they value in research. The technical terms used to articulate a research paradigm are ontology, epistemology, and axiology. Ontology interrogates the nature of reality. A realist ontology assumes that reality is objective, external, and independent of human perception. This view posits that there is a single, tangible reality that can be observed, measured, and understood through empirical evidence. Realist researchers rely on methods that aim to uncover universal truths by minimising subjectivity and personal biases. For example, in experimental and quasi - experimental research, a realist ontology would guide researchers to seek out observable phenomena that exist regardless of individual interpretation. Their approaches would focus on quantifiable data to support their findings, such as questionnaires, experimental methods, and statistics. In contrast, a relativist ontology suggests that reality is not a fixed entity but is instead shaped by individual and collective experiences. According to this view, reality is subjective and can vary f", "source": "Demystifying Research Paradigms_ Navigating Ontology Epistemolog.pdf"}, {"id": 136, "text": "omena that exist regardless of individual interpretation. Their approaches would focus on quantifiable data to support their findings, such as questionnaires, experimental methods, and statistics. In contrast, a relativist ontology suggests that reality is not a fixed entity but is instead shaped by individual and collective experiences. According to this view, reality is subjective and can vary from one person or group to another, influenced by social, cultural, and historical contexts. Researchers who adopt a relativist ontology emphasise the importance of understanding how people make sense of their world. Here, the focus is on capturing the richness of human experience, acknowledging that multipl e realities may coexist. R eality is seen as fluid and negotiated, with knowledge being constructed through interactions between the researcher and the subject. Researchers working within this ontology tend to use qualitative methods to explore how individuals or groups interpret their experiences, recognising that these often-times different interpretations are equally valid reflections of reality. Their approaches focus on establishing rapport, encouraging participants to reflect on their experiences, developing empathy, using active listening, and engaging in storytelling to represent their participants’ realities. Epistemology explores the nature of knowledge and the processes through which we come to understand it. There are three common epistemologies. The first common epistemological position asserts that reality can be objectively known through empirical observation, if researchers use the right tools and methodologies. This epistemology is grounded in the belief that knowledge exists independently of human perception and can be uncovered through careful measurement and testing. Proponents of this view focus on quantifiable data, seeking to establish universal truths that can be verified and replicated. In the 2700 The Qualitative Report 2024 natural sciences, for example, researchers often operate under this epistemology, designing experiments to measure variables and draw conclusions that are free from personal bias.

The goal is to generate reliable and objective knowledge about the world that holds true across different contexts. This approach assumes that if the right tools are used, the researcher can objectively capture the essence of reality without their observations being influenced by personal interpretation or external factors. In contrast, the second epistemological view suggests that reality is partially knowable, but only through the subjective lenses of individuals. From this perspective, knowledge is not objective but rather constructed by individuals based on their experiences, beliefs, and social interactions. Researchers who adhere to this epistemological view argue that reality is created in the minds of people and, therefore, can only be understood through studying the interpretations and meanings that individuals attach to their experiences. This epistemology often leads to qualitative research methods, in which the goal is to explore the diversity of perspectives rather than uncover a singular, objective truth. Finally, a third epistemological perspective holds that reality is constantly evolving, making it impossible to fully know or understand at any given moment. This view, often associated with pragmatism, recognises that knowledge is dynamic and context -dependent. Pragmatists believe that reality and knowledge are not static entities but are always in a state of flux, shaped by ongoing experiences and changing conditions. As a result, they argue that knowledge is always incomplete, and researchers must remain flexible, adapting their methods and interpretations as new insights emerge. This epistemological stance encourages a mixed - methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative techniques to capture the complexity of reality at a particular moment while acknowledging the limits of what can be known. Axiology plays a pivotal role in shaping the ethical and moral dimensions of research. It prompts researchers to consider the role of their own values, beliefs, and biases in the design, conduct, and interpretation of their studies. Researchers must reflect on the values that guide their choice of topics, methods, and even the way they present their findings.

Axiology plays a pivotal role in shaping the ethical and moral dimensions of research. It prompts researchers to consider the role of their own values, beliefs, and biases in the design, conduct, and interpretation of their studies. Researchers must reflect on the values that guide their choice of topics, methods, and even the way they present their findings. For example, a researcher may choose to study topics that align with their personal or societal values, such as social justice, equity, or sustainability. In doing so, axiology forces them to confront the ethical implications of their work, including how their own perspectives may shape their approach to research and the potential impact their findings may have on the world. This reflection is essential for maintaining integrity and transparency in research, as it highlights the ways in which personal and cultural values influence the research process, from the formulation of questions to the dissemination of results. A key debate in axiology concerns whether research can and should be value -free. Some researchers, particularly those aligned with positivist paradigms, strive for objectivity, believing that research should minimise personal bias and that knowledge can be discovered independently of the researcher’s values. This approach promotes the idea that scientific inquiry can achieve neutrality through rigorous methods that exclude subjective influences. However, achieving complete objectivity is often questioned, a s the very act of choosing a research question or interpreting data is shaped by the researcher’s worldview and cultural context. Critics of the value -free ideal argue that no research can ever be entirely objective because all researchers bring their own beliefs, biases, and ethical considerations to the table, consciously or unconsciously. Even in studies that rely on purely quantitative methods, decisions about what to measure, how to measure it, and how to interpret the results are influenced by the researcher’s values. Many researchers, especially those working within constructivist, social constructionist, interpretivist, and critical paradigms, acknowledge that research is inherently value-laden, and that subjectivity is not only unavoidable but can, in fact, be a strength.

These researchers argue that embracing the role of values in research allows for deeper insights into Lynette Pretorius 2701 human experiences and societal structures, so researchers should continuously examine how their own values and those of their participants influence the production of knowledge. Braun and Clarke (2022), for example, developed a comprehensive prompting stra tegy to help researchers explore their positions of power and marginalisation to help them better articulate their positionalities. Through reflexivity (the ongoing process of self -examination by researchers to identify and account for the ways their values influence their work), researchers can foster greater trust and accountability in the research process. For example, in studies involving marginalised or vulnerable populations, the researcher’s commitment to ethical principles such as respect, empathy, and social justice would shape the entire research process, from data collection to analysis. Consequently, rather than striving to eliminate subjectivity, researchers embracing the value-laden nature of research view their positionality as an integral part of the research, which can lead to richer and more nuanced understandings of complex social phenomena. What Are the Most Common Research Paradigms? Table 1 summarises the ontologies, epistemologies, and axiologies which make up the most commonly used research paradigms: Positivism, Post-Positivism, Constructivism, Social Constructionism, Interpretivism, Pragmatism, and Critical Realism. These are described in more detail in the rest of this section, with reference to additional sources for further information.

Researchers must be reflexive about biases. Positivism Positivists argue that there is one objective reality that can be observed and understood through scientific inquiry, regardless of individual experiences or perspectives. In this paradigm, phenomena are assumed to follow universal laws and can be measured accurately through systematic observation and experimentation. In positivism, the goal of research is to discover these objective truths using methods that reduce subjectivity and bias. For instance, in fields such as physics or biology, researchers aim to uncover generalisable facts about the natural world that apply consistently a cross different contexts. This approach treats reality as stable and unchanging, allowing for the development of theories and models that can explain and predict natural or social phenomena. Central to the positivist paradigm is the belief that the researcher is independent of the subject they are studying. Positivists maintain that research should be conducted in a way that minimises the influence of the researcher’s values, biases, or personal interpretations on the findings. This separation between the r esearcher and the subject allows for what is considered objective observation, where knowledge is generated solely from empirical evidence—data that can be observed, measured, and verified through the senses.

Like positivists, post-positivists believe in an objective reality that can be studied and understood through empirical investigation. They still rely on rigorous scientific methods to collect data and test hypotheses, maintaining that observable phenomena exist independently of human perception. However, post-positivists differ in their recognition that complete objectivity is an ideal that is ultimately unattainable. They argue that researchers, being human, inevitably bring their values, beliefs, and biases into the research process, whether consciously or unconsciously. In this way, post - positivists acknowledge that choices about what to study, the methods employed, and how results are interpreted are all influenced by value judgements. As a result, post -positivists emphasise the need for reflexivity. While they continue to strive for objectivity, they recognise that research is not entirely free from the researcher’s influence. Consequently, post-positivist researchers take deliberate steps to minimise the impact of these biases on their work. Post - positivists also encourage transparency in the research process, openly discussing the potential value implications of their choices and interpretations. By being reflexive and critical of their role in the research, post -positivists aim to produce knowledge that, while not entirely free from bias, is credible, reliable, and reflective of a realistic approach to studying the complexities of the world.

Constructivism Constructivists believe that reality is subjective and that this reality can only be partially known because it is constructed in the minds of individual people. This means that each person’s reality is unique, reflecting their personal experiences, emotions, and interactions with their environment. As a result, constructivist researchers acknowledge that individuals can only partially know reality because it is filtered through subjective perceptions. What one person perceives as reality might be different from another’s, even if they are observing the same situation. A key aspect of constructivism is its emphasis on the role of social interactions in 2704 The Qualitative Report 2024 shaping individual realities. Constructivists believe that people do not construct their realities in isolation but through ongoing interactions with others and within the broader social, cultural, and historical contexts in which they live. For example, a person’s understanding of identity, gender, or social norms is influenced by the people they interact with, the cultural values they are exposed to, and the historical events through which they hav", "source": "Demystifying Research Paradigms_ Navigating Ontology Epistemolog.pdf"}, {"id": 144, "text": "that people do not construct their realities in isolation but through ongoing interactions with others and within the broader social, cultural, and historical contexts in which they live.

Consequently, constructivist researchers aim to u ncover how shared experiences and cultural contexts influence the formation of individual realities. Rather than attempting to eliminate bias, constructivist researchers embrace the value- laden nature of research, understanding that their involvement in the research process shapes the knowledge that is produced. This leads to a co- construction of knowledge, where the researcher and participants work together to create a shared understanding. This collaborative approach not only deepens the research findings but also ensures that the perspectives and voices of the participants are respected and valued. Additionally, constructivist researchers are often motivated by a desire to create positive social change. They are concerned with the ethical implications of their work, aiming to use their findings to challenge existing power structures, address social inequalities, and contribute to societal wellbeing.

Both paradigms operate from a relativist ontology, in which reality is not viewed as an objective, independent entity but rather as something that is constructed through human thought, interactions, and social processes. Reality, from this perspective, is u nderstood as inherently shaped by social contexts, historical moments, and collective practices, which constantly evolve as societal values and beliefs shift. The epistemology of both paradigms also centres around the idea that knowledge is socially constr ucted rather than being a discovery of objective truths. Concepts such as class, race, and even scientific knowledge are not seen as static truths waiting to be discovered but are instead constructed through social interactions, discourse, language, and cultural norms. Similarly, both paradigms share the view that research is value-laden. The difference between constructivists and social constructionists becomes clearer when their research foci are examined. While constructivists are primarily concerned with how individuals personally construct meaning and understand their experiences, soci al constructionists place greater importance on “collective meaning -making” and the role of society in shaping knowledge. Social constructionists focus on how social engagement, societal Lynette Pretorius 2705 structures, and power dynamics influence shared realities, making collective processes central to their analysis. As a result, constructivist researchers often emphasise “individual perspectives,” exploring how unique personal experiences shape understanding, while social constructionist researchers seek to examine how societal factors such as language, culture, and social norms, come together to create and maintain “shared realities” across communities.

Interpretivists acknowledge that knowledge is inherently partial; we can never fully understand someone else’s experience in an objective sense, but we can strive to interpret and make meaning of it. This paradigm highlights the importance of recognising t he diversity of human experience and the idea that multiple, equally valid realities can coexist, depending on the perspectives of those involved. At the heart of interpretivism is the notion that individuals are the experts of their own experiences. Interpretivists focus on uncovering the meanings that people attach to their experiences. This paradigm values the subjective interpretations and emotions that shape people’s understanding of the world around them, and it emphasises the importance of context in shaping these interpretations. Consequently, interpretivist researchers encourage participants to reflect on their own experiences and articulate their interpretations.

For example, when studying a social issue like immigration, an interpretivist would se ek to understand how different individuals within immigrant communities interpret their own experiences , such as feelings of belonging, identity, or alienation, rather than analysing immigration statistics or policy impacts. Interpretivists aim to capture the richness and complexity of these personal narratives, recognising that individuals are the best sour ces of insight into their own lives. While interpretivism acknowledges the influence of both researcher and participant values, its central focus is on understanding and interpreting the values, meanings, and experiences that participants attach to their own experiences. Interpretivism is also often confused with constructivism due to these paradigms’ similar ontologies and axiologies. However, there is a key epistemic difference between constructivism and interpretivism: the researcher’s understanding of their role in relation to the participants’ realities. In constructivism, knowledge is seen as actively co-constructed through the interaction between the researcher and participants. Constructivists believe that the researcher plays an integral part in shaping the underst anding of reality, as their own perspectives, biases, and interpretations inevitably influence the research process. This 2706 The Qualitative Report 2024 paradigm sees knowledge as something fluid, created through dialogue and interaction. The researcher is not a neutral observer but a collaborator who engages with participants to jointly develop insights about the research topic. In contrast, interpretivism places more emphasis on the researcher as an interpreter of meanings rather than a co -creator of knowledge. The interpretivist researcher is more passive in shaping the findings, instead focusing on uncovering and interpreting the subjective meanings and experiences that participants bring to the study. Therefore, while constructivists view the research process as a shared construction of meaning, interpretivists maintain a certain level of separation, seeking to understand and explain participants’ reali ties without actively influencing or creating them through the research relationship.

Pragmatism Pragmatism is a flexible paradigm that suggests research methods should be chosen based on what best addresses the research question. Pragmatists believe reality is constantly changing or debated, so they do not commit to a single reality or method of inquiry. This allows for a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods as is deemed necessary for the topic under investigation. For example, in a study on the impact of educational interventions, a pragmatist researcher might collect quantitative test scores to measure academic improvement alongside qualitative interviews to explore students’ personal experiences with the intervention. This flexibility enables researchers to draw on the strengths of both approaches, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. While pragmatists value objective evidence such as measurable, replicable results, they also appreciate the importance of subjective experiences in shaping our understanding of reality.

This integrative approach allows pragmatists to balance the need for factual, reliable data with an understanding of the social, cultural, and emotional dimensions of the research context. Ultimately, pragmatism is grounded in a philosophical stance that prioritises practical outcomes and real-world applications of research. For pragmatists, the value of research lies not in its ability to produce abstract theories or universal truths but in its capacity to generate knowledge that can solve real-world problems. This means that pragmatist researchers are often focused on the implications of their work, aiming to create actionable solutions that can improve people’s lives.

Critical Realism Critical realism offers a stratified perspective on the nature of reality, bridging the gap between the objective and subjective aspects of knowledge. Critical realists assert that an objective reality exists independently of human perception, but it is no t entirely accessible through direct observation. Instead, this reality is understood as being layered, comprising observable phenomena as well as deeper, often hidden structures or mechanisms that shape those phenomena. For instance, critical realists may argue that we can observe social behaviours and outcomes but the underlying causes, such as economic systems, cultural norms, or power relations, are not always immediately visible.

Instead, this reality is understood as being layered, comprising observable phenomena as well as deeper, often hidden structures or mechanisms that shape those phenomena. For instance, critical realists may argue that we can observe social behaviours and outcomes but the underlying causes, such as economic systems, cultural norms, or power relations, are not always immediately visible. This layered view of reality encourages researchers to dig beneath surfac e-level observations and seek out the often -complex interactions between different levels of reality. A key tenet of critical realism is the recognition that an individual’s understanding of the world is subjective and shaped by societal, historical, and cultural contexts. While an objective reality exists, people’s interpretations of it are influenced by their personal experiences, social positions, and the power dynamics within which they are embedded. For example, two individuals may experience the same event but interpret it differently based on their socio -economic background, cultural and/or religious beliefs, or historical context. Critical realism acknowledges this complexity and aims to balance an appreciation for the subjective nature of human understanding with the pursuit of objective truth. This dual focus on both objective structures and subjective experiences allows critical realism to explore how power, history, and culture shape knowledge and reality. Critical realism is deeply intertwined with a commitment to understanding the world as it is while also striving to transform it for the better. Critical realists believe that researchers bring their own beliefs, biases, and values to the research process and urge researchers to critically reflect on and disclose their values and how these might impact their research.

The Influence of Paradigms on Research Processes Understanding and choosing a research paradigm is crucial because it shapes the entire research process, from framing the research question to deciding on methodologies and methods, and finally analysing and reporting the results. By understanding and consciously choosing a research paradigm, researchers ensure that their work is cohe rently designed. In other words, by clearly identifying a paradigm, the researcher ensures that the theoretical assumptions about reality, knowledge, and values align with the chosen methods and analytical techniques. This coherence strengthens the study’s internal logic and makes the research design more transparent and defensible. Articulating the paradigm thus provides a structured, consistent approach, allowing the researcher to align all aspects of the project and maintain clarity throughout the study. Without a clear articulation of the research paradigm, there is a risk of mismatching methods and philosophical assumptions, which can lead to confusion, lack of clarity in the study’s goals, and potentially invalid findings. Imagine a researcher who is studying the impact of a new educational technology on student engagement in a secondary school. The goal is to understand how the use of this technology affects student participation. Without carefully considering their research paradigm, the researcher might be tempted to dive straight into data collection using a questionnaire and data analytics. Through this realist approach (e.g., positivism or post-positivism), they might treat the data as if it will provide objective, universal truths about the technol ogy’s effectiveness in improving student participation. However, this approach might miss important, subjective elements of how students experience the technology.

Through this realist approach (e.g., positivism or post-positivism), they might treat the data as if it will provide objective, universal truths about the technol ogy’s effectiveness in improving student participation. However, this approach might miss important, subjective elements of how students experience the technology. This could result in overlooking factors such as emotional engagement or social dynamics that cannot be captured through numerical data alone. On the other hand, if the researcher adopts a more relativist approach (e.g., constructivism, social constructionism, interpretivism, or critical realism), they will approach the study differently. Instead of relying on data analytics, they might focus on understanding the students’ lived experiences while using the technology. Through qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews, observations, or focus groups, the researcher would uncover how individual students interpret the technology based on their unique backgrounds and interactions with their peers and teachers. This approach could reveal that while the technology boosts engagement for some students, others may find it isolating or difficult to use, adding a deeper layer of understanding that purely quantitative data might not capture. Consequently, the choice of research paradigm shapes not only the methods used but also the type of knowledge the researcher generates. By carefully aligning their research questions and design to their paradigm, the researcher ensures that the study is coherent, ethically sound, and methodologically appropriate which ultimately leads to more nuanced and useful findings. Research Questions The paradigm a researcher adopts fundamentally shapes the nature of the questions they ask. For instance, in positivism, research questions are often framed to test hypotheses or measure variables, seeking to establish causal relationships or correlations. Constructivist, Lynette Pretorius 2709 social constructionist, interpretivist, and critical realist paradigms, however, encourage researchers to develop questions that explore the meanings, experiences, and perceptions of participants, with the aim of understanding the complexity of human behaviour in particular contexts.

Constructivist, Lynette Pretorius 2709 social constructionist, interpretivist, and critical realist paradigms, however, encourage researchers to develop questions that explore the meanings, experiences, and perceptions of participants, with the aim of understanding the complexity of human behaviour in particular contexts. These questions are then further refined based on the focus of the paradigm, leading to studies that focus on either societal change or a deeper understanding of lived experience. Pragmatism allows for flexibility, meaning research questions can be designed to solve specific problems. Methodological Choices Methodological choices are also profoundly influenced by the researcher’s paradigmatic stance. Positivists might lean towards structured methodologies that mimic the scientific method, employing quantitative measures such as surveys or experiments. Constructivists, social construct ionists, and interpretivists tend to prefer qualitative methods such as in -depth interviews, participant observation, or reflexive thematic analysis, which allow for a deep dive into participants’ experiences and the meanings they ascribe to them. Pragmatists select methods based on what best answers the research question, often combining qualitative and quantitative approaches in a pragmatic, problem -solving orientation. Critical realists might use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to explore both the surface phenomena and the underlying social or structural mechanisms contributing to these phenomena. Table 2 provides a summary of some commonly used methodologies and methods for the different paradigms.

Findings are usually presented as insights into the participants’ perspectives, often narratively or through rich, descriptive accounts, emphasising the subjective nature of knowledge. The pragmatist researcher focuses on practical outcomes, guiding the selection of data collection and analysis techniques that are most likely to produce actionable insights. Results are usually presented in a way that highlights their practical implications. Critical realists analyse data to identify not just what is happening but why it is happening, looking for patterns that reveal the influence of hidden structures or power relations. Findings are usually presented in a way which highlights or critiques the underlying societal mechanisms leading to a particular phenomenon. Ethics of Paradigms The ethical considerations surrounding research paradigms are critical. First, i t is important to highlight that the seven paradigms discussed in this article are by no means the only ones that exist. Historically, some perspectives and bodies of knowledge have been overlooked or marginalised in research. This extends to the developme nt and recognition of research paradigms as well. As such, I encourage you to also explore other diverse paradigms, especially those that may be considered non -traditional or o riginate from non -Western contexts. Embracing a broader spectrum of paradigms can enrich our research approaches and outcomes, offering a wider range of valuable insights and perspectives. Lynette Pretorius 2711 Second, different paradigms inherently shape the relationship between researchers and their participants. This is especially important in qualitative research, where participant voices and experiences should be at the forefront. Constructivists and social constructionists , for example, emphasise the co -construction of knowledge between researcher and participant, which raises ethical questions about how power dynamics are navigated. In these paradigms, participants are not just sources of data but active co ntributors to the research process.

Constructivists and social constructionists , for example, emphasise the co -construction of knowledge between researcher and participant, which raises ethical questions about how power dynamics are navigated. In these paradigms, participants are not just sources of data but active co ntributors to the research process. Researchers must be mindful of the ethical responsibility to honour the voices of their participants, ensuring that they are represented accurately and with respect. This requires a deep reflection on power imbalances, particularly when working with vulnerable or marginalised groups, such that the researcher’s positionality may affect how the research is conducted and how findings are interpreted. Third, reflexivity requires researchers to continuously examine their own biases, assumptions, and values throughout the research process, acknowledging how this influences their interactions with participants and their interpretation of findings. This int rospective approach is ethically significant because it encourages transparency, but it also demands that researchers take responsibility for how their perspectives shape the research outcomes. For instance, in critical research that aims to challenge societal structures or highlight inequalities, the researcher’s values are explicitly tied to the research agenda. While this can lead to socially impactful research, it also means that ethical reflexivity is crucial to ensure that the researcher is not imposi ng their own agenda on participants or misinterpreting their voices to fit a preconceived narrative. The ethical dilemma here is to balance the researcher’s values with a commitment to faithfully represent the participants’ perspectives. Finally, paradigms that acknowledge research as inherently value -laden explicitly position the researcher’s values as integral to the research process. In value- laden research, researchers must navigate the tension between advancing their own ethical commi tments and remaining open to the voices and experiences of participants, even when these do not align with their own values. Thus, the ethical dimensions of paradigm choice are closely tied to axiology, as researchers must be aware of how their values infl uence every aspect of their study, from design to dissemination.

By engaging with the ethical implications of their chosen paradigm, researchers can foster more transparent, accountable, and ethically sound research practices. Conclusion Ontology, epistemology, and axiology form the philosophical backbone of a research project, shaping the methods used and the interpretation of findings. The purpose of this article was to provide a foundational understanding of seven key research paradigms (positivism, post- positivism, constructivism, social constructionism, interpretivism, pragmatism, and critical realism), each with distinct perspectives on the nature of reality, knowledge, and values in research. By introducing these paradigms in an accessible way, this article aims to assist researchers in identifying the paradigm that best aligns with their worldview an d research objectives. Understanding these foundational concepts is a crucial first step in designing methodologically sound and philosophically coherent studies. One significant limitation of this article is that it only offers an introductory exploration of each paradigm, which does not capture the full depth and complexity of the philosophical debates and nuances underlying these perspectives. As a result, this article may oversimplify certain aspects of these paradigms to make the concepts accessible, potentially limiting the depth of understanding for advanced researchers or those well-versed in philosophical inquiry. Consequently, once a researcher has identified which paradigm resonates most with their view of the world and their research goals, it is essential to further explore the complexities of that 2712 The Qualitative Report 2024 paradigm.

By consciously selecting and clearly articulating their research paradigm, researchers not only enhance the integrity and rigour of their own studies but also contribute to the ongoing disciplinary dialogue about the nature of reality and knowledge construction. Researchers must remain reflexive, continually reassessing their paradigmatic choices considering new theoretical developments and societal changes. This reflexive practice encourages the academic community to critically engage with and expand upon existing paradigms, ultimately leading to the advancement of knowledge across disciplines. In this way, research paradigms serve as a crucial bridge between the philosophical foundations of a study and its practical execution, ensuring that research is both meaningful and impactful.

With this definition in mind, the purpose of this paper is to point out the added value of articu lating the research paradigm of a mixed methods case study that examined the preparedness of university graduates for today’s job market. The paper intends to examine how the exploration of participants’ worldviews of the phenomena under inquiry lends itself to pragmatism, a paradigm that underpins the philosophical premise of mixed methods research (MMR). The discussion demonstrates (1) how pragmatism as a research paradigm informs the chosen mixed methods design, and (2) how the chosen research paradigm, pragmatism, values multiplicity of worldviews that enrich the development of viable solutions for the problem under inquiry. Articulating the research paradigm that informs the overall design of a study is oftentimes marginalized especially in case studies. This paper intends to explain the value for highlighting the philosophical paradigm of case studies. Keywords: P ragmatism, Mixed methods research, Paradigm, Methodological pluralism, Case study 1. Introduction A paradigm is a set of conventions that profile our understanding of how we acquire knowing . Articulating the research paradigm that guides a study explains the rationale that supports its chosen methodolog y. What derives a research paradigm is the theoretical/conceptual framework of the study. Therefore, there should be consistency between the conceptual framework and research paradigm. 2. Types of Research Paradigms 2.1 Positivism Positivism emphasizes that we know what we want to know through objective and empirical observation. Investigating problems requires the analysis of observable facts to generate objective knowledge. Positivists value quantitative analysis of observable data that depend on testing hypotheses and identification of causal relationship between variables (Park, et al., 2020). 2.2 Constructivism/Interpretivism This school of thought emphasizes that we understand the world and its problems through the subjective and socially constructed ", "source": "Elgeddawy+and+Abouraia+033.pdf"}, {"id": 164, "text": " analysis of observable facts to generate objective knowledge. Positivists value quantitative analysis of observable data that depend on testing hypotheses and identification of causal relationship between variables (Park, et al., 2020). 2.2 Constructivism/Interpretivism This school of thought emphasizes that we understand the world and its problems through the subjective and socially constructed nature of knowledge. Constructivists view the researcher as an active participant in interpreting the constructed knowledge of participants. That is, knowledge is not to be discovered but individually constructed. Each individual constructs and reconstructs his own views in accordance with his/her own background knowledge and experience ( Elander and Cronje, 2016). Constructivists believe that it is important to contextually understand a research phenomenon through the perspectives and experiences of its stakeholders who construct their meaning within specific contexts. Constructivist researchers normally value qualitative research methods (Lee, 2012). 2.3 Pragmatism Knowledge, according to pragmatists such as John Dewey, is to be acquired by the action that takes place between man and his environment. This type of knowledge is changing, dynamic, developing, and oriented toward its consequences in human nature. Maintaining that all our human experiences, such as fears, hopes, and etc, are deeply rooted in nature, Dewey asserts that both nature and experience are intertwined and reflect each other. 2.3.1 Pragmatism as a research paradigm As a research approach, pragmatism emphasizes that we understand the world and solve its problems through the application of subjective and objective methods. Pragmatist researchers are flexible and practical in finding viable solutions to the phenomenon under inquiry. They recognize the importance of having multiplicity of perspectives and worldviews in solving research problems. Pragmatism derives pluralistic mixed methods research (MMR) . Also, pragmatists value both the objective quantitative worldview and the subjective experience of stakeholders. They situate the research problem within its specific context (Foster, 2024). 71 Proceedings of the 23rd European Conference on Research Methodology for Business and Management Studies, ECRM 2024 Mohamed Elgeddawy and Mahmoud Abouraia 2.3.2 Pragmatism and mixed methods research It is i", "source": "Elgeddawy+and+Abouraia+033.pdf"}, {"id": 165, "text": " Also, pragmatists value both the objective quantitative worldview and the subjective experience of stakeholders.

For example, if the research question centralizes the perceptions and lived experiences of your participants in assessing and addressing the problem under inquiry, pragmatism in this case would be appropriate (Liu, 2022). A pragmatist view would provide you with the opportunity to gather both subjective qualitative data and objective quantitative data. Pragmatism supports the mixing of research methods to get an in-depth understanding of the research problem and its solution. P ragmatism values individuals’ views and life experiences (Kaushik and Walsh 2019). The nature of the research questions with a focus on methodological pluralism would match a pragmatic view of the world which “… is typically associated with mixed methods research . The focus is on the consequences of research, on the primary importance of the question asked rather than the methods, and multiple methods of data collection inform the problem under study” (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2007, p.23). From a pragmatic viewpoint , the nature of the research questions derives the research methods. For example, if the research questions of the study put a premium on the constructed lived experiences of the research participants in addressing the problem under study, pragmatism would be suitable. The suitability of pragmatism as a guiding philosophical research paradigm in this case is significant as it “places high regard for the reality of and influence of inner world of human experience in action (and where) knowledge is viewed as being both constructed and based on the reality of the world we experience and live in” (Johnson and J. Onwighbuzie, 2004, p.18). 2.3.3 Priority of the pragmatic researcher A pragmatic researcher prioritizes the practical implications of the research outcomes in solving the problem under investigation.

Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches provides pragmatist researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the problem within its conte xt. The focus of a pragmatist is to come up with actionable knowledge that addresses the problem and provides guidance to decision makers. The main ai m is to generate practical knowledge that is actionable, viable and relevant to r eal world challenges (Turyahikayo, 2021). As a philosophy, pragmatism centralizes contextual, actionable knowledge, and the intersection between knowing, experiencing, and acting. For pragmatists, to know is to inquire and learn through an experiential process. As a philosophy, pragmatism facilitates the methodological pluralism of MMR. It informs the design of the MM study and guides an integrative approach that combines survey data with qualitative interviews (Creswell, 2003). The integration of both types of data, guided by the principles of pragmatism , enriches our understanding of the phenomenon under inquiry. Pragmatism, as such, positively impacts the MM R design where different methods complement and enhance each other conclusion (Shan, 2021). 3. Wy do we Need Knowledge of the Research Paradigm? Knowledge of the research paradigm is indispensable for the development of a well -thought-out research. The knowledge of the conventions of a research paradigm makes the process of knowledge production and interpretations of the analyzed data meaningful. The process of meaning making that research produces requires a solid philosophical understanding of its discourse. We do require knowledge of the research paradigm that underpins a study to understand how a solution is being shaped and constructed ( Feilzer, 2010). Form a philosophical pragmatic perspective, our understanding of the phenomenon under inquiry can be facilitated through methodological pluralism and multiplicity of perspectives.

Form a philosophical pragmatic perspective, our understanding of the phenomenon under inquiry can be facilitated through methodological pluralism and multiplicity of perspectives. The discourse of pragmatism makes it easy for us to be open to multiplicity of interpretations. The philosophical paradigm of the research is an enlightening force that comes into play and acts from behind, while we produce and interpret the MM discourse ( Johnson and Onwuegbuzie 2004). Often, the more we experience multiplicity of views related to a specific issue, the more our worldviews expand. We are, then, always already developing, constructing, and reconstructing horizons of understanding the phenomenon under inquiry. 4. The Methodological Pluralism of MMR Pragmatism, as a research paradigm, deepens our understanding of three types of knowledge: knowledge of ourselves, knowledge of others and knowledge of experiences in the world. From a pragmatic perspective, the three types of knowledge are interrelated and interdependent and contribute to our constructed beliefs and horizons of understanding. The methodological pluralism that MMR embraces allows us to be exposed to diverse 72 Proceedings of the 23rd European Conference on Research Methodology for Business and Management Studies, ECRM 2024 Mohamed Elgeddawy and Mahmoud Abouraia worldviews, while enriching our understanding of the act of discourse interpretation ( Bibi, H., Khan, S. and Shabir, M. 2022). Pragmatism allows M ixed Methods researchers to reflectively think about their biased interpretation and understanding of other people and the world at large. The pragmatic researcher is always open to experience various worldviews related to the phenomenon under investigation. This openness allows the interpretation of the quantitative data to be cross checked with the interpretation of qualitative data. It also allows the pragmatic researcher to reconsider the interpretation of both data sets thoughtfully and attentively. Pragmatic MM researchers hold themselves open, while discursive discourse goes back and forth between the two types of data. An in-depth understanding of the phenomenon under inquiry require es an exploration of the two horizons ( the quantitative and the qualitative). 5.

Pragmatism and the Fusion of Horizons For a pragmatic researcher, the point of understanding is a point where the quantitative horizon fuses with the qualitative one. It is a point where interpretation and understanding of one horizon yields a concurrent consideration of the other. As such, both horizons ( the quantitative and the qualitative) co -exist in relation to each other. These divergent research horizons never erode one another. The pragmatist M ixed Methods researcher believes in the inevitable existence of both horizons. In fact, you can not erode, uproot or throw away one horizon for the sake of the other. Rather, pragmatism deepens the rationality of each horizon, making it worth taking into consideration. 6. Key Takeaways The gain we get from the pragmatic philosophy is that our constructed quantitative understanding of a phenomenon cannot be isolated from our constructed qualitative one. All in all, this paper endorses the vision that the philosophical understanding of pragmatism as a research paradigm yields a stance that honors exploring multiplicity of world views in solving problems. The pragmatic discourse of the research paradigm demonstrates that our understanding of the nature of research, in terms of theory and practice, has a lot to do with the process we follow in making sense of the world with its concerns and problems.

This article aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the relationship between MMR and paradigms by analyzing two main claims discussed in the literature: (a) MMR is a new paradigm and (b) MMR mixes different paradigms. Focusing on the notion of paradigms used to support each claim, it clarifies why MMR can be considered a new paradigm and discusses conditions under which it is possible to mix two or more para- digms within a single study. This clarification promotes a more clear-cut use of concepts such as paradigms and worldviews in the literature. Keywords mixed methods, paradigms, epistemological pluralism, ontological pluralism The combination of quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study is not new in the social sciences (Maxwell, 2016), and some of the earlier mixed methods research (MMR) stud- ies, such as the Lynds’ Middletown studies (Lynd & Lynd, 1929, 1937) and the Hawthorne Studies (Mayo, 1993; Roethlisberger & Dickson, 1964) are still considered prominent MMR examples (Biddle & Schafft, 2015; Denscombe, 2008; Hunter & Brewer, 2003). Despite this long tradition, however, it was only in the last few decades that social scientists began to con- sider MMR as a distinct research approach. Indeed, MMR proponents claim that the combina- tion of quantitative methods (such as surveys and questionnaires) and qualitative methods (such as interviews and ethnographical studies) should be understood as a distinct research methodol- ogy, and carefully examine the practicability of such a combination in relation to some philoso- phical debates about scientific paradigms and pragmatism. The main tenor in this literature is that MMR not only constitutes an interesting and promis- ing new technique but also raises some questions about its status as a research paradigm. According to some, the mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods entails a novel approach that should be understood as anew research paradigm.

According to others, the novelty of MMR is the possibility tocombine different paradigms within the same study. How to explain such conflicting positions? The answer has been already suggested in the MMR community (Bergman, 2010; Denscombe, 2008; Freshwater & Cahill, 2013): the term 1University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, UK Corresponding Author: Virginia Ghiara, Department of Philosophy, University of Kent, Cornwallis North West, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NF , UK. Email: V .Ghiara@kent.ac.uk ‘‘paradigm’’ is used in a number of different ways. Notably, in a commentary on Joseph Maxwell’s article on paradigms, Johnson recognized 24 different uses of the concept ‘‘para- digm’’ in the social and behavioral sciences literature (Johnson, 2011, p. 32). This is not sur- prising: even the philosopher who popularized the concept of ‘‘paradigms’’ in science, Thomas Kuhn, used the concept in more than 20 different ways (Masterman, 1970). If we consider the MMR literature, scholars appear to use two main notions of paradigm: some identify the notion of paradigm with the Kuhnian concept of ‘‘exemplars shared by a communities’’, understood as an intellectual framework and a set of concrete puzzle-solutions shared within a scientific community (Denscombe, 2008; Hemmings, Beckett, Kennerly, & Yap, 2013; Morgan, 2007); others adopt the idea of paradigms as ‘‘worldviews’’, according to which a paradigm is a framework that reflects researchers’ assumptions about reality, metho- dology, and epistemology (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Guba & Lincoln, 1994). Although this distinction helps clarify some of the claims concerning the use of paradigms in MMR, it does not solve the conflict between the idea that MMR entails a new paradigm and the position according to which MMR can mix paradigms. On the one hand, even when the concept of paradigms is used in a single way, scholars tend to discuss both claims.

On the one hand, even when the concept of paradigms is used in a single way, scholars tend to discuss both claims. For instance, when scholars endorse the notion of paradigms as worldviews, they either articulate a clear con- nection between a specific worldview and MMR (like in the cases of the transformative frame- work and pragmatism) or recognize that what distinguishes MMR from other approaches is the mixture of different worldviews (see, for instance, Johnson, 2012; Mertens, 2003; Morgan, 2007; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003; Uprichard & Dawney, 2016). On the other hand, even the association between these claims and some specific notions of paradigm would not answer, per se, the question concerning the truth of such statements: can we really define MMR as a new paradigm? Is the mixture of worldviews possible? To complicate matters even further, claims concerning the possibility of mixing paradigms are often discussed in the light of the incom- mensurability thesis a` la Guba and Lincoln (1994), according to which diverse paradigms are incompatible and, therefore, cannot be mixed. In this article, I focus on three conceptual questions, namely, (a) if MMR can be considered a new paradigm, (b) whether it is possible to mix paradigms within a single study and (c) how MMR scholars should tackle the dilemma of the incommensurability thesis. To facilitate the reading of the article, let me provide a quick preview of the answers I will promote in the next sections. First, in the second section I will argue that the MMR approach entails a new paradigm in one of the Kuhnian senses, as it is possible to find a set of exemplars shared by some scholars who see themselves as members of a ‘‘MMR community’’. Second, in the third section I will suggest that MMR can mix paradigms only if we understand paradigms as worldviews based on ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions.

Finally, in the fifth section I will use two examples to show how different worldviews can be mixed within a single study. ‘‘MMR Is a New Paradigm’’ On many occasions, the claim that MMR is a new paradigm has been justified and examined in Kuhnian terms. Kuhn’s philosophy and his several definitions of paradigms, indeed, allowed social scientists considerable room for maneuver (Freshwater & Cahill, 2013). At an early stage of development, the differences between quantitative, qualitative, and MMR were classified on epistemological, ontological, and axiological grounds, by following in part the Kuhnian notion of paradigms as disciplinary matrices (Silverman, 2013; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). 12 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 14(1) However, on closer inspection, scholars recognized that epistemological, ontological, and axio- logical assumptions can change within the quantitative, qualitative, and MMR communities. This consideration led them to relax their idea of paradigms, adopting a more general Kuhnian version of paradigms (Kuhn, 1970). According to this view, members of a specific sci- entific community come to an agreement over a system of principles and rules about theory, application, and instrumentation when good illustrations show how the system works. A set of good illustrations, also called ‘‘exemplars’’, shared by a well-defined community, can be under- stood as a paradigm. This notion of paradigms as exemplars shared within a community has been endorsed by a growing number of scholars. Notably, Johnson and Onwuegbuzie (2004), in one of the most cited papers on MMR, spelled out this notion of paradigms in terms of ‘‘research culture’’, in which members of a community share the same position about the nature and conduct of research. Three years later, Morgan (2007) recognized the importance of shaping the debate on paradigms in the social sciences through the idea of communities sharing research beliefs. It is the discussion concerninghow to do research, according to Morgan, that helps clarify why we can claim that MMR is a new paradigm. Around the same tim", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 175, "text": "ity share the same position about the nature and conduct of research. Three years later, Morgan (2007) recognized the importance of shaping the debate on paradigms in the social sciences through the idea of communities sharing research beliefs. It is the discussion concerninghow to do research, according to Morgan, that helps clarify why we can claim that MMR is a new paradigm. Around the same time, Denscombe (2008) agreed with this perspective and took it one step further, suggesting that the notion of paradigms as scien- tific communities sharing exemplars (what he called ‘‘communities of practice’’) was the only notion sufficiently flexible to accommodate the internal variations and inconsistencies charac- terizing research paradigms in the social sciences. The idea that MMR proponents see themselves as members of a new scientific community that shares exemplars is also supported by various considerations. MMR scholars can now choose between different ways to disseminate their research findings, among which specific MMR peer-reviewed journals and MMR conferences, that reinforce the idea of being members of a new MMR scientific community (this idea has been proposed also in several research articles; see, for instance, Denscombe, 2008; Morgan, 2007; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010). The transition from infancy to maturity in MMR, furthermore, was marked by greater clarity as to what exemplars were to be considered within the community. Recently, Maxwell (2016) observed that, despite the systematic combinationsof qualitative and quantitative approaches, pre- viously no one started a discussion about the different typologies of combinations, or about the way of conceptualizing such a mixture. Similarly, by examining the interviews conducted with 20 social scientists in 2004, Bryman made clear that almost all interviewees struggled to nominate an exemplary MMR study (Bryman, 2007). Over the past 10 years, however, the MMR community’s intention to identify such specimens has constantly increased. In two editorials, Creswell and Tashakkori (2007, 2008) started to categorize some good examples of MMR studies. In parallel, the use of exemplary MMR studies as illustrative examples became common in descriptions of research designs (Creswell, Plano Clark, Gutmann, & Hanson, 2003; Morgan, 2007). Moreover, discussing the social sciences’ situation, Johnson considered that,", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 176, "text": "as constantly increased.

In parallel, the use of exemplary MMR studies as illustrative examples became common in descriptions of research designs (Creswell, Plano Clark, Gutmann, & Hanson, 2003; Morgan, 2007). Moreover, discussing the social sciences’ situation, Johnson considered that, in general, scho- lars identify themselves as ‘‘quantitative’’, ‘‘qualitative’’, or ‘‘mixed methods’’ researchers, as if they were part of one of these research communities, rather than talking about their identities in terms of worldviews such as postpositivism, constructivism, or pragmatism (Johnson, 2011, p. 33). This consideration helps me to raise another issue: the so-called ‘‘quantitative’’, ‘‘quali- tative’’, and ‘‘MMR’’ communities are far from being coherent and unified systems of thought. Members of the same community share some key ideas about how research should be conducted and recognize that they belong to the same community. However, there can be often deep divi- sions among members regarding the ontological, epistemological, and axiological assumptions guiding research. It is exactly for this reason, I argue, that it is important to distinguish between exemplars shared within communities and worldviews. On the one hand, it is possible to claim that the MMR approachentails a new paradigm because there is a new set of exemplars (the Ghiara 13 paradigm) shared and discussed within the MMR community. On the other hand, the distinction between the numerous worldviews that populate the social sciences helps recognize both that MMR studies can mix them, and that these worldviews can coexist within the MMR community (i.e., members of the MMR community can adopt different worldviews). ‘‘MMR Combines Different Paradigms’’ MMR is based on the mixture of quantitative and qualitative approaches within a single study. While, as described above, some have suggested that this approach should be understood as a new paradigm, other scholars have observed that MMR does not imply only the combination of different methods but also the mixture of different research paradigms. This claim has been jus- tified by observing that, although in some cases MMR studies mix just methods (such as inter- views and questionnaires) or methodologies (as in the case of a MMR study base", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 177, "text": "this approach should be understood as a new paradigm, other scholars have observed that MMR does not imply only the combination of different methods but also the mixture of different research paradigms. This claim has been jus- tified by observing that, although in some cases MMR studies mix just methods (such as inter- views and questionnaires) or methodologies (as in the case of a MMR study based on the mixture of ethnographical works and survey research), there are more complex situations where MMR studies are characterized by a mixture of different (and not always explicit) ontological or epistemological assumptions. The idea that MMR combines paradigms emerged in several debates on MMR. To begin with, this assumption is evident in some technical discussions about the dominant/less-dominant and the equal status designs. According to these accounts, the dominance of one method in MMR can be reflected in the presence of a dominant paradigm in the study. Such discussions, however, are possible only if social scientists accept the possibility of combining different para- digms within the same study. The dominant/less-dominant design is described as the situation in which, while conducting MMR studies, social scientists rely on a single dominant paradigm, and only small components are drawn from alternative paradigms. On the contrary, the MMR equal status design is referred to the situations where more paradigms are equally relevant to a study (Creswell, 1994; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). In addition, many authors have recognized the crucial role played by the mixture of different paradigms and have discussed the purpose of this combination (in general, identified either in complementarity or in a dialectical aim, where the interaction between different paradigms allows researchers to explore and hold different points of view about a subject). Greene (2006) considered the mixture of paradigms as the main difference between mixed methods and multimethod studies, and she encouraged researchers to incorporate different perspectives and stances in MMR studies. It is through divergence and dis- sonance, Greene claimed, that MMR scholars can examine taken-for-granted understandings. Uprichard and Dawney (2016) took a similar position, arguing for a ‘‘diffractive’’ approach in MMR, where research questions can be studied through different (ontological and epistemolo", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 178, "text": "he encouraged researchers to incorporate different perspectives and stances in MMR studies.

Uprichard and Dawney (2016) took a similar position, arguing for a ‘‘diffractive’’ approach in MMR, where research questions can be studied through different (ontological and epistemologi- cal) pathways, and diffraction not only allows for such a multiplicity but also emphasizes it. Similarly, Johnson (2012) advocated what he called ‘‘dialectical pluralism’’, a metaparadigm whose dialectical approach requires to appropriately listen to each research question and pur- pose, enabling hence researchers to combine ideas from competing paradigms. Although not always explicit, the underlying assumption behind such claims seems to be that MMR can mix differentontological and epistemological stances. The term ‘‘paradigms’’ is here used to denote something very similar to the ‘‘worldviews’’ often described in the social sciences. Bryman’s interviews with MMR scholars (Bryman, 2007) clarified this point. One of the social scientists who took part in the interview considered the difficulties associated with the combination of objectivist and subjectivist accounts, especially when the MMR study is based on what can be defined as a social construct. The epistemological problem in such cases is how to combine an account according to which the phenomenon under study is real, with a constructivist account that either problematizes the phenomenon or denies its reality. 14 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 14(1) It is the mixture of ontological and epistemological assumptions, according to these claims, that characterizes MMR. Paradigms are not understood in terms of exemplars shared by commu- nities but as philosophical worldviews based on ontological, epistemological, and methodologi- cal assumptions. Table 1 shows a few examples of the use of worldviews in the MMR literature, while Figure 1 illustrates the difference between paradigms as sets of exemplars shared by com- munities and paradigms as worldviews. As illustrated, the quantitative, qualitative, and MMR communities are not associated only with specific worldviews and can employ several of them to conduct their studies. Of course, a community can prefer the use of a subset of worldviews (for instance, the", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 179, "text": "ature, while Figure 1 illustrates the difference between paradigms as sets of exemplars shared by com- munities and paradigms as worldviews.

Of course, a community can prefer the use of a subset of worldviews (for instance, the qualitative community is often linked to the use of realism and constructi- vism), but this should not lead to the claim that there is a one-to-one relationship between a Figure 1. The pluralistic debate in MMR can be clarified by considering the use of the notion of paradigms in the literature. On the one hand, the term ‘paradigms’ has been used to denote the sets of exemplars shared by the MMR, the quantitative and the qualitative communities. On the other hand, the term ‘paradigms’ has been used to describe systems of ontological, epistemological and methodological assumptions that in the social sciences are known by the name of ‘worldviews’. The second meaning of the term ‘paradigms’ is used when researchers argue that MMR can mix different paradigms. Table 1. A List of Worldviews Discussed and Used in the MMR Literature.

Furthermore, the mixture of worldviews is not necessary for all MMR studies: there might be cases where scholars mix quantitative and qualitative methods while adopting one unique worldview. There is an important caveat to this argument. The mixture of philosophical standpoints might not lead to a clear integration: assumptions could be too different to be fully merged.

This does not mean, however, that MMR cannot mix paradigms, or that researchers should avoid doing it. Most of the scholars who argued for this combination clarify that one of the goals is to give voice to paradigmatic dissonances. Differences are real and characterize the MMR commu- nity; therefore, MMR should welcome the emergence of diversions and should focus on proble- matizing the research object and its study (Johnson, 2012; Uprichard & Dawney, 2016). Are Paradigms Incommensurable? The combination of quantitative and qualitative methods has often been discussed in relation to the so-called ‘‘incommensurability thesis’’. There are two distinct forms of incommensurability. The first form is taken from mathematics, where incommensurability denotes ‘‘lack of common measure’’. Irrational numbers, for instance, can be described as incommensurable in relation to rational numbers, given that there is no common measure in which to express both rational and irrational numbers. In this sense, incommensurability is associated with the idea that there are no common standards of scientific theory appraisal, and consequently it is impossible to find a standard according to which researchers can univocally compare and evaluate competing the- ories coming from competing paradigms. The second form entails that approaches based on dif- ferent philosophical assumptions are incompatible and cannot legitimately be combined. In this sense, paradigms are claimed to be incommensurable. Evaluative Incommensurability The former type of incommensurability was described by Kuhn in his bookThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions(1970) and has been one of the most controversial and extensively dis- cussed Kuhnian concepts. Kuhn took incommensurability to be associated with his notion of paradigms as disciplinary matrices, made of symbolic generalizations, metaphysical assump- tions, values, and exemplars. He described incommensurability as the lack of common evalua- tive standard between rival theories, and claimed that this was due to the fact that such theories cannot be phrased in a common system of linguistic terms: Two men who perceive the same situation differently but ne", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 181, "text": "f paradigms as disciplinary matrices, made of symbolic generalizations, metaphysical assump- tions, values, and exemplars. He described incommensurability as the lack of common evalua- tive standard between rival theories, and claimed that this was due to the fact that such theories cannot be phrased in a common system of linguistic terms: Two men who perceive the same situation differently but nevertheless employ the same vocabulary in its discussion must be using words differently. They speak, that is, from what I have called incom- mensurable viewpoints. (Kuhn, 1970, p. 200) For instance, according to this interpretation, Newton and Einstein belonged to two different paradigms given that they thought that the universe was populated by distinct fundamental enti- ties. It follows that if one understands the term ‘‘mass’’ in Einstein’s sense, he takes the term to mean something different from Newton’s idea of ‘‘mass’’, and cannot derive Newton’s laws (Bird, 2000). In other words, when scientists from different paradigms observe a phenomenon, they use a set of terms to describe and study it. Some of these terms might be used by scientists from different paradigms, who nevertheless ‘‘attach’’ the terms to the world differently. Consequently, any communication between such scientists can only be partial, and it is impos- sible to prove the superiority of one theory over another. It should be noted that Kuhn did not 16 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 14(1) claim that there is a total communication breakdown between proponents of rival paradigms. In his view, incommensurability is local, and even though total translation might be difficult, par- tial communication, based on not fully reconcilable standpoints, is very likely (Sharrock & Read, 2002). Having said that, what does it mean for MMR? The impossibility of a complete communica- tion and of a shared standard of evaluation, I suggest, does not have important consequences for the discussion on MMR, as it does not lead to the claim that different paradigms cannot be mixed. As mentioned above, many authors have argued for a dialectical approach based on the acceptance of the difficulties related to the communication and comparison of those results coming from different worldviews (Greene, 2006; Johnson, 2012; Uprichard & Dawney, 2016).

As mentioned above, many authors have argued for a dialectical approach based on the acceptance of the difficulties related to the communication and comparison of those results coming from different worldviews (Greene, 2006; Johnson, 2012; Uprichard & Dawney, 2016). When different worldviews lead to contrasting results, it is often impossible to obtain a unity of perspective: how to evaluate and to reconcile them, indeed, is far from being trivial. Kuhn’s discussion on incommensurability sheds a new light on these difficulties without justifying the rejection of MMR. One last point should be discussed. If we accept Kuhn’s idea of incommensurability, there is one consideration that needs to be tackled: the coexistence of paradigms. Indeed, incommensur- ability was described by Kuhn in relation to the occurrence of a scientific revolution, when the old and new paradigms cannot be completely compared (Bird, 2000; Kuhn, 1970). In MMR, however, we are talking about many coexisting paradigms with their own ontological and epis- temological assumptions, and this appears in contrast to Kuhn’s account unless we can recog- nize the possibility of an imminent scientific revolution. This point was discussed many years ago by Lakatos, who then proposed the idea of competing scientific research programs: the Kuhnian idea of normal science, where a paradigm obtains the monopoly, is something rare in reality given that science is in general characterized by competing paradigms (Lakatos, 1968). MMR can hence be interpreted as an illustrating example of what Lakatos called ‘‘competing pluralism’’, where competing research programmes coexist (Lakatos, 1970, p. 155). Incommensurable Worldviews As for the latter form of incommensurability, according to which worldviews are incompatible and cannot legitimately be combined, Guba and Lincoln proposed this idea in their debate on qualitative research a few decades ago. While in their chapter in theHandbook of Qualitative Research, they argued for the existence of incommensurable philosophical assumptions between different worldviews (Guba & Lincoln, 1994), 10 years later they recognized some commensur- ability between distinct naturalistic paradigms, and strict incommensurability between two broad metaparadigms (Guba & Lincoln, 2005). According to this form of incommensurabi", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 183, "text": "r chapter in theHandbook of Qualitative Research, they argued for the existence of incommensurable philosophical assumptions between different worldviews (Guba & Lincoln, 1994), 10 years later they recognized some commensur- ability between distinct naturalistic paradigms, and strict incommensurability between two broad metaparadigms (Guba & Lincoln, 2005). According to this form of incommensurability, one cannot embrace two or more systems of philosophical assumptions within one study: worldviews are different and in contrast to each other. This kind of divergence came to be known as the paradigm wars (Denzin & Lincoln, 2011) and reinvigorated a complex set of arguments known by the name of the purist thesis and the incompatibility thesis (Denzin, 2010). The contrast between incommensurable worldviews was exacerbated: worldviews were associated with specific methods, with the consequence that different methods became incompatible. Although many have already highlighted the misunderstanding behind the supposed one-to- one correspondence between worldviews and methods (Denzin & Lincoln, 2011; Donmoyer, 2006; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003), it remains to understand whether it is really impossible to mix contrasting worldviews. The section ‘‘Combining Paradigms’’ will describe in detail some cases in which worldviews have been successfully mixed, but for the moment I consider again one issue mentioned above: if the same phenomenon is explored through a constructivist and a Ghiara 17 realist approach, it is questionable how to combine the discussions based on these two contrast- ing worldviews (Bryman, 2007). As an example, the study of mental illness as a mere social construct appears in contrast with the realist approach according to which mental illness is a ‘‘real’’ condition. My suggestion is that there are at least some situations in which this contrast does not pre- vent the combination of such paradigms. Hacking (2001) provided some examples wherein rea- lism and constructivism can be combined despite the tension between them. Let us consider his discussion about the idea of ‘‘women refugees’’: what is socially constructed in this case is not the individual persons, the women refugees. It is a reality, indeed, that some women are threat- ened, driven out of their homes by force, or feel so much fear that they are forced to flee.

Let us consider his discussion about the idea of ‘‘women refugees’’: what is socially constructed in this case is not the individual persons, the women refugees. It is a reality, indeed, that some women are threat- ened, driven out of their homes by force, or feel so much fear that they are forced to flee. Realists can claim, hence, that women refugees are real women experiencing specific, real situations. Nonetheless, what can be understood as a social construct is the classification of ‘‘woman refugee’’. Hacking recalled Moussa (1992) and explained that the idea of women ref- ugees is embedded in a system of complex of institutions, advocates, newspaper articles, court decisions, and immigration proceedings. In other words, the social construction refers to the woman refugee as a kind of person, a classification that is always associated with a system within which it works. In the case of women refugees, realism and constructivism, even though based on contrast- ing assumptions, provide compatible observations: while women refugees are real persons, and being a woman refugee is a real condition, the idea of ‘‘women refugees’’ is a social construct. What is more, combining these worldviews helps develop a more holistic understanding of the social condition of women refugees, given that the idea resulting from the social construction can have an impact on the real person who is escaping from her home. The classification of ‘‘women refugees’’ can exert an effect on how women feel about themselves and behave. Hence, indirectly, the classification affects the real people and their actions. The discussion above shows that, in some circumstances, worldviews based on contrasting ontological and epistemological assumptions can be used within a single study. There might be cases in which worldviews are really incommensurable, but this should not be generalized in a claim against the possibility of mixing paradigms. The feasibility of this combination, further- more, can lead to complex forms of ontological and epistemological pluralism, as I shall explore in the next section. Combining Paradigms While the new ‘‘trilogy’’ of major research paradigms entails the Kuhnian idea that paradigms are sets of exemplars shared by scientific communities; in section ‘‘MMR Combines Different Paradigms’’ I have argued", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 185, "text": "gms. The feasibility of this combination, further- more, can lead to complex forms of ontological and epistemological pluralism, as I shall explore in the next section. Combining Paradigms While the new ‘‘trilogy’’ of major research paradigms entails the Kuhnian idea that paradigms are sets of exemplars shared by scientific communities; in section ‘‘MMR Combines Different Paradigms’’ I have argued that the consideration that MMR can combine different paradigms is based on another concept of paradigms, according to which paradigms are worldviews with spe- cific ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions. Mixing paradigms, hence, means combining different assumptions. In this section, I offer two examples of how such a combination can be carried out. Epistemological Pluralism: Assessing and Evaluating the Eat Right! Be Fit! Program The quantitative/qualitative distinction, often described with the expression ‘‘paradigm war’’, descends largely from the difference between the epistemological questions at the heart of quantitative and qualitative studies. Most of the quantitative studies are underpinned by a spe- cific account of what should be accepted as warrantable knowledge: scientists should conduct studies in which the distance between the observer and the observed is preserved with the aim 18 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 14(1) to maintain objectivity. On the contrary, numerous qualitative researchers are in general com- mitted to observing the world from the point of view of the actor rather than maintaining any distance. Observers should be close enough to the object of study to gain a contextual under- standing of the phenomenon, and objectivity is ruled out due to this proximity and to the fact that any knowledge is gained within a social context. It follows that, when quantitative and qualitative approaches are combined, multiple episte- mological frameworks can be embodied within a single study: in other words, mixed methods studies might be characterized by epistemological pluralism. To clarify how epistemological pluralism can be achieved in mixed methods studies, let us con- sider one case that has been discussed over the last few years: the MMR assessment and evalua- tion of the program Eat Right! Be Fit! recently developed by some researchers at a Midwestern university.

To clarify how epistemological pluralism can be achieved in mixed methods studies, let us con- sider one case that has been discussed over the last few years: the MMR assessment and evalua- tion of the program Eat Right! Be Fit! recently developed by some researchers at a Midwestern university. As described by Greene (2015), for the evaluation of the program researchers have decided that they will employ both postpositivism and constructivism. In accordance with the post- positivism strand, aspiring on generalizable result based on structured quantitative evidence, researchers will develop a quasi-experiment; with respect to the constructivist worldview, based on the assumption that meaningful understandingshould be contextual, they will conduct mini- case studies informed by unstructured ethnographic observations. Both methods (and worldviews) will be employed to assess the implementation of the program and evaluate its effects. Epistemologically, the quasi-experiment can assess the implementation of Eat Right! Be Fit! through the objective documentation of the nature and extent of activities done in the class- rooms: each classroom schedule will be analyzed, and the time spent doing physical activities will be systematically reported. Furthermore, researchers will collect data about how many chil- dren walk or bike to school, and the kinds of food eaten by them. The mini-case studies, instead, will aim at understanding whether and how the program has an impact on the class- room rhythms and learning by means of contextual explorations into the daily life of children (Greene, 2015). The postpositivist approach, hence, will assess the quality of the program by considering only the program implementation, without taking into account the context in which the program is offered and the reality perceived by the children involved in the program. On the contrary, these aspects will be at the center of the constructivist approach, whose goal will be to capture how children perceive the program and its purposes. Similar epistemological discrepancies between postpositivism and constructivism can be observed also regarding the decisions about the evaluation process.

Similar epistemological discrepancies between postpositivism and constructivism can be observed also regarding the decisions about the evaluation process. On the one hand, the quasi- experiment study will collect standardized health measures such as the body mass index, which will be then compared with measures about the same children collected in the past, and measures about children from the same area not involved in the program. The success of the program, in this sense, is associated with the percentage of children obtaining specific values in some stan- dard indicators of child health. The aim of the constructivist approach, on the other hand, will not be to capture the bodily changes obtained through the program but to explore how children are engaged with it. To do so, researchers will interview children, teachers, and parents to obtain insights about the way in which the program has an impact on the children’s life (Greene, 2015). The epistemological assumptions behind these evaluation processes show substantial differ- ences: the postpositivist aim is to collect objective and generalizable evidence of the success of the program; the constructivist goal is to develop anintersubjective understanding taking into account multiple realities such as those lived by the children and the teachers. Such differences could lead to divergent results: the constructivist approach might indeed evaluate the program as successful, while the postpositivist might show the absence of bodily changes in the classrooms involved. As described in section ‘‘MMR Combines Different Paradigms’’, however, the idea that MMR should intentionally allow for disharmony to reach unforeseen insights is now shared Ghiara 19 and supported by many MMR proponents. This, furthermore, appears in line with one of the main purposes of MMR: initiation, a type of research whose goal is to find out paradoxes and conflicts that lead to a reframing of the research question and of the study. This goal is often described using Rossman and Wilson’s words (1985, p. 633): ‘‘Rather than seeking confirma- tory evidence, this [initiation] design searches for the provocative’’. Epistemological pluralism is likely to promote this particular aim of MMR.

Epistemological pluralism is likely to promote this particular aim of MMR. Ontological Pluralism: Explaining Insurgent Collective Action in El Salvador Let us imagine we have a certain phenomenon we want to address through a mixed methods study: probably, we will use a qualitative approach to gain an in-depth understanding of the cau- sal process that has led to the phenomenon, while we will use a quantitative approach to verify whether the correlation between our putative causal factors and the effect is present in the con- text of study and, perhaps, even in a broader context. In other words, our qualitative approach would enable us to claim that a single, complex, instance of causation exists, while our quantita- tive approach would help us understand how a causal phenomenon operates generally. Although this might be seen just as a mixture of methods, what has become increasingly clear is that these methods can be focused on causal relationships at different levels of abstraction. Ontologically, hence, the MMR study would adopt a pluralistic view. At the ontological level, indeed, a similar study entails two different assumptions. On the one hand, we are assuming that a single instance of a causal relation is real, and it might be a unique causal event. We can call this assumption singular causation. On the other hand, we are assuming that there are more general casual relationships that can be found at the population level. We can call this assumption general causation (for more discussions on this, see Johnson, Russo, & Schoonenboom, 2017). In many cases, even though such assumptions are not discussed when the mixed methods studies are conducted, their presence is tangible. Let us consider Wood’s (2003) study aimed at understanding why peasants in El Salvador decided to join rebel movements. To answer such a question, the main approach used by Wood was qualitative ethnographic interviews both with peasants and some members of the elite opposed to the peasants (i.e., landlords, military offi- cers, government officials). The interviews were aimed at obtaining a contextual understanding of the phenomenon", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 189, "text": "aimed at understanding why peasants in El Salvador decided to join rebel movements. To answer such a question, the main approach used by Wood was qualitative ethnographic interviews both with peasants and some members of the elite opposed to the peasants (i.e., landlords, military offi- cers, government officials). The interviews were aimed at obtaining a contextual understanding of the phenomenon through the personal and community histories of the individuals involved. The causal relationship explored in this way, hence, was completely embedded into a personal, social, political, and historical system: as argued in the book, the decision to give a contribution to the insurgency was determined by specific personal and political circumstances that led the peasants from different cultural backgrounds to fight for social justice. It was not a mere class conflict, and the civilian supporters were offered very few benefits during the insurgency (Wood, 2003). Those who decided to join rebel movements were often motivated by the history of violence against family members and neighbors, by the brutality of the actions perpetrated by the government, and by personal, moral, and affective benefits they received through partici- pation (Wood, 2003). The concept of causation addressed through the case studies corre- sponded to a complex phenomenon existing at the local level: as argued by Wood, indeed, the causal processes identified through her analysis were alllocal and interacted in intricate ways during the period of the civil war (Wood, 2003). This view of causation as a local, multifaceted relationship was combined with another idea of causation as an abstract and generalizable phenomenon. Wood (2003) established a dialogue with scholars of collective action and social movements, whose aim is to develop general causal explanations of social phenomena. Thanks to the evidence collected, she cast light on the rele- vant role that pleasure of agency could play in similar situations: 20 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 14(1) [...]l o ng-subordinate social actors grant to the exercise of agency per se.

To act in defiance of unjust authority, to claim recognition as equal subjects whose personhood needs be respected, to act effectively for the realization of essential interests, and to publicly assert the power of collective efficacy may be important reasons for the emergence of insurgent collective action elsewhere as well as in El Salvador. (Wood, 2003, p. 253) To support her generalization, Wood (2003) also analyzed a rural household survey carried out at the end of the war, elections data, and some databases documenting the changes in agrarian property rights during and after the insurgence. Furthermore, she illustrated the generalizable claim through a formal quantitative model based on the dynamics of a coordination (assurance) game. The combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches enabled Wood to achieve two distinct purposes: on the one hand, she developed a causal narrative of the complex interactions of personal, historical, and political factors that have generated the specific phenomenon under study; on the other hand, she provided a causal explanation of the general phenomenon whereby repression and a sense of agency can foster mobilization. As suggested at the beginning of this section, these two outcomes, although linked, can be interpreted as different with respect to the ontological assumptions guiding Wood’s (2003) examination. The narrative describing the reasons why those particular peasants decided to join rebel movements was based on the expectation that such a single, complex, causal phenomenon existed locally. On the contrary, the development of a general hypothesis linking, in different contexts, repression, agency, and mobilization, entailed the assumption that the causal phenom- enon under investigation could operate generally, and that its analysis might be used to explain and predict other phenomena caused by the same causal link. In these terms, ontological pluralism could be perfectly consistent with one of the MMR’s purposes: expansion. Indeed, expansion occurs when the findings from the two approaches expand insights into the phenomenon of interest by addressing different aspects of such a phe- nomenon.

Given that, in MMR studies, qualitative findings can help answer the question con- cerning the occurrence of that particular causal phenomenon in a specific context, whereas quantitative findings can be used to address the question about the generality of such a causal link, the mixture of different ontological assumptions would allow for the achievement of this goal. Conclusion In this article, I have thoroughly examined three conceptual questions: (a) whether the MMR approach can be considered a new paradigm, (b) whether it is possible to mix paradigms within a single study, and (c) how MMR scholars should tackle the dilemma of the incommensurabil- ity thesis. Despite the apparent contrast, I have argued that it is possible to support both the claim the MMR approachentails a new paradigm and the claim that MMRcombines different paradigms. To begin with, if we associate the first claim with the Kuhnian concept of paradigms as exem- plars shared within a community, it is possible to see how both the discussions about MMR exemplars and the presence of a strong MMR community support the idea the MMR is a new paradigm. If we consider how different worldviews (such as pragmatism, realism, constructi- vism, postpositivism, etc.) are used in MMR, furthermore, it is possible to find at least some cases in which the aim of MMR is to combine them within a single study. This idea, moreover, Ghiara 21 seems consistent with some recent discussions on the dialectical aim of MMR (Greene, 2006; Johnson, 2012; Uprichard & Dawney, 2016). As concerns the incommensurability thesis, I have clarified that there are two distinct forms of incommensurability: in the first form, incommensurability is associated with the idea that there are no common standards of evaluation in science, and that it is impossible to compare different paradigms due to communication breakdowns; the second form entails that approaches based on different philosophical assumptions are incompatible and cannot legitimately be com- bined. I have argued that the first form of incommensurability does not ", "source": "ghiara-2019-disambiguating-the-role-of-paradigms-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 192, "text": "mmensurability is associated with the idea that there are no common standards of evaluation in science, and that it is impossible to compare different paradigms due to communication breakdowns; the second form entails that approaches based on different philosophical assumptions are incompatible and cannot legitimately be com- bined. I have argued that the first form of incommensurability does not have important conse- quences for MMR because it does not lead to the claim that different paradigms cannot be mixed. Furthermore, I have shown that some MMR proponents have already discussed and accepted the difficulties related to the communication and comparison of the results coming from different worldviews. As for the second form of incommensurability, I have claimed that there are at least some situations in which the contrast between worldviews does not prevent the combination of such paradigms, and I have described the mixture of worldviews in Hacking’s (2001) work. Next, I have discussed two examples that show how different assumptions can be used in a single MMR study: the first study was characterized by epistemological pluralism; the second study illustrated how to combine ontological assumptions. These considerations clarify not only the importance of the discussions about paradigms in MMR but also the need for a more clear-cut use of concepts such as paradigms, worldviews, and pluralism in the literature. I hope this article will provide fertile ground for further explor- ing how MMR scholars identify their exemplars and what will be the future directions of MMR as a scientific community.

It also“reﬂects the position that the researcher has chosen to adopt within a given research study” and describes the researcher’s relationship to their research subjects. What the researcher chooses to study, how it is carried out, and the outcomes are all inﬂuenced by their position. In this paper, I argue that the positionality of a researcher is shaped by a variety of factors, including gender, race, personal experiences, values, and beliefs. These factors then inﬂuence the researchers’ assumptions, methods of accessing and interacting with participants, the questions they pose, and how they interpret theﬁndings. For higher degree research in the social sciences, there should be a section that clariﬁes researcher positionality. Making these declarations gives the study clarity and credibility in that the researcher is aware of their‘insider and outsider hat’ so to say. This paper discusses ways in which Masters, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Social Work, Doctor of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, and Ph.D. scholars can explain positionality in their research design. Crucial elements that must be disclosed in the study are the identities, viewpoints, and positions of the researchers. This work contributes to the growing corpus of scholarship on researcher positionality, which is based on myﬁndings as a novice researcher conducting qualitative research. My paper takes an inductive systematic review approach which relates to noting observations and seeking toﬁnd patterns within them. I provide examples from my Ph.D. thesis which looked at academic English writing skills ofﬁrst-year undergraduate students. The examples will be helpful to novice researchers and post-graduate students interested in providing precision in conducting qualitative meth- odology and examining positionality in their study. They can use the article as a starting point in approaching the concept of researcher positionality and ways in which it can be embedded in their study design.

Keywords researcher positionality, qualitative research methodology, insider-outsider, thesis, research design, higher degree research In early 2023, I was preparing to submit my Ph.D. thesis in Linguistics which used grounded theory methodology (Urquhart, 2022 ) when my supervisor mentioned “posi- tionality of the researcher.” We hadﬁnalised the thesis, but this particular section was yet to be properly articulated in the write up. Prior to this moment, I had only received a brief introduction of positionality; suddenly, I had to change the introductory chapter of the thesis to reﬂect this component. It was one of the most challenging sections of the thesis to write. I looked up papers toﬁnd a framework that I could adapt. Among the literature available, I foundHolmes (2020) the most helpful as it provided a theoretical approach and explained pivotal concepts relating to researcher position- ality. Using the framework provided by Holmes (2020),I came to understand the gaps in the research for novice researchers and the use of positionality. Because I encoun- tered issues writing about m y researcher positionality, I decided to write a paper that a newcomer to qualitative research methodology might use as a stepping stone. My approach to researcher reﬂexivity came from a grounded theorist stance. Part of being a practicing grounded theorist is to respond positively to such moments of inspiration (Goundar, 2023a, 2023d). 1Graduate Research School, University of New England, Australia Corresponding Author: Prashneel Ravisan Goundar, Graduate Research School, University of New England, TC Lambel, Armidale 2351, Australia.

Readers interested in a more theoretical background on po- sitionality of the researcher should readHolmes (2020). Holmes (2020, p. 1) asserts that positionality is especially crucial for research since it characterises the researcher’s perspective and the stance they take regarding a project and its social and political setting. Those interested in seeing how researcher positionality played out in a study can readBourke (2014). In his paper,Bourke (2014, p. 1) presents issues of positionality that he encountered during the completion of a qualitative research project. Similarly, Yip (2024)uses a reﬂectivity approach to describe how she used positionality in her doctoral research. My article highlights the foundational work ofYip (2024), Holmes (2020),a n dBourke (2014), as a practical approach for researchers to include posi- tionality in a thesis research design. Therefore, this paper takes an inductive systematic review approach which relates to noting observations and seeking toﬁnd patterns within them (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Proudfoot, 2023). Drawing on grounded theory research and examples from my thesis, this article contributes to ongoing discissions (Bourke, 2014 ; Braun & Clarke, 2006; Holmes, 2020 ; Proudfoot, 2023) in the researcher positionality space to highlight key positions that qualitative researchers should acknowledge in their study. These include, researcher posi- tionality, insider-outsider lens, balance of power, and lived experiences. Doing so will demonstrate the researchers ’ willingness to declare how the data was not inﬂuenced by their involvement with the participants or the institution where the data collection took place (Ozano & Khatri, 2018; Shah, 2004; Wilson et al., 2022). The identities, opinions, and positions of the researchers are crucial components that must be revealed in the study (Savin-Baden", "source": "goundar-2025-researcher-positionality-ways-to-include-it-in-a-qualitative-research-design.pdf"}, {"id": 202, "text": "ved experiences.

The identities, opinions, and positions of the researchers are crucial components that must be revealed in the study (Savin-Baden & Major, 2023; Yip, 2024, p. 222). Based on my observations as a novice researcher doing qualitative research on the academic English writing skills of ﬁrst-year undergraduate university students in Fiji (Goundar, 2023a, 2023d), this work adds to the expanding body of scholarship on researcher positionality. Researcher Positionality In qualitative research at the Masters, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Social Work, Doctor of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, and Ph.D. level, it is critical to clarify the researcher’s position (Goundar, 2023d; Kerstetter, 2012; Merriam et al., 2001; Yip, 2024). Positionality is the process of identifying and ac- knowledging potential conﬂicts of interest that a researcher can encounter in a research project.Rowe (2014)deﬁnes researcher positionality as a tool to describe a researcher’sw o r l d v i e wa n d standpoint when conducting research. A researcher’s position might stem from things like community-oriented roles, employee- related roles, cultural contexts, or institutional conﬂicts. The re- searcher could outline and clarify how these can be managed. Savolainen et al. (2023)point out that a positionality statement is also known as a reﬂectivity statement which should be used to recognise that all research contributions are made by subjective individuals with a particular perspective on the world based on their background. Whereas subjectivity statements should be used to provide the reader with the choices made by the researchers such as selecting methodologies, interpreting data, choosing a topic or formulating hypothesis (Ratner, 2002). Identifying researcher positionality can be a time con- suming activity and one that not only involves a considerable amount of soul searching but needs a thorough reﬂection (Holmes, 2020; Savin-Baden & Howell-Major, 2013). It may take time to identify the various positions a researcher has when conducting research, and the researcher may even end up not fully disclosing all t", "source": "goundar-2025-researcher-positionality-ways-to-include-it-in-a-qualitative-research-design.pdf"}, {"id": 203, "text": "esis (Ratner, 2002). Identifying researcher positionality can be a time con- suming activity and one that not only involves a considerable amount of soul searching but needs a thorough reﬂection (Holmes, 2020; Savin-Baden & Howell-Major, 2013). It may take time to identify the various positions a researcher has when conducting research, and the researcher may even end up not fully disclosing all their roles. I have provided some limitations of positionality in my re ﬂections in the ﬁnal section of this paper. Holmes (2020, p. 3) explained that“positionality affects the totality of the research process as it acknowledges and recognises that researchers are part of the social world they are researching, and that this world has already been interpreted by existing social actors.” Simply stated, researcher positionality is a way to safeguard against any partiality that can be questioned at the conclusion of a study (Dhillon & Thomas, 2019; Goundar, 2023d). In the qualitative research process, scholars can note their positionality from the research proposal stage to begin with. It is appropriate to identify and acknowledge the researcher’s position at the beginning of the research project (Yip, 2024). Matters such as how the data will be collected, the recruitment process, and obtaining the ethics approval can be things to consider in the initial conception of a study (Wilson et al., 2022; Yip, 2024). It is ideal for higher degree researchers to have conversations with their supervisors on the ways positionality impacts their research design. For example, in the data collection stage if the study is based on primary school classroom peda- gogies and the teacher is also the supervisor of other teachers in the same school, this needs to be made clear in the introduction of the proposal. The researcher should demonstrate how their po- sition as supervisor will not requireobligatory participation from the teachers. This is important as it provides transparency to the research process and meets ethical requirements regarding vol- untary participation. After the research proposal stage, once the data has been collected, it is suggested to re ﬂect on researcher positionality. In light of the data analysis, is that the researcher’s positionality not only affects power dynamics withparticipants, it also inherently inﬂuences the way researchers make sense of their data (Go", "source": "goundar-2025-researcher-positionality-ways-to-include-it-in-a-qualitative-research-design.pdf"}, {"id": 204, "text": "h process and meets ethical requirements regarding vol- untary participation.

In light of the data analysis, is that the researcher’s positionality not only affects power dynamics withparticipants, it also inherently inﬂuences the way researchers make sense of their data (Goundar, 2023d). We have our own biases when conducting a study but we ought to be sincere in the research process (Bourke, 2014; Rowe, 2014). In the examples that I provide in this article, I have used pseudonyms to protect the identity of individuals and institutions. Framing Researcher Positionality in Introductions In the introductory thesis chapter, a section on positionality should explain the background of the researcher and how they have come into the particular study (Foote & Gau Bartell, 2 International Journal of Qualitative Methods 2011; Savin-Baden & Howell-Major, 2013). Here is an il- lustration of how this can be achieved:My academic and personal credentials put me in a unique position to gain insights into the research questions at hand. I taught un- dergraduate and postgraduate linguistics courses at Green Lantern University in Gotham city. However, the material that constituted my thesis was collected and analysed when I was on study leave from work to pursue my Ph.D. As a male, born- and-raised Fiji Islander, I had vested interests in the way students perform in higher education contexts, particularly with regard to their English-language background, compe- tency and skills. My interest stems from attending a rural primary school where English and standard Hindi languages were used as medium of instructions and moving into a semi- urban high school where the English language was the sole medium of instruction(Goundar, 2023d). The example above sheds light on who the researcher is and how they have come into the study by pointing out their research interests. The relationship between the researcher(s) and the chosen topic is declared which helps the audience understand the true nature of the researcher’s positionality (McMullin, 2023; Wilson et al., 2022; Yip, 2024). Insider-Outsider Lens Qualitative studies bring out the lived experiences of research participants. Their narratives provide rich data for a study.

The relationship between the researcher(s) and the chosen topic is declared which helps the audience understand the true nature of the researcher’s positionality (McMullin, 2023; Wilson et al., 2022; Yip, 2024). Insider-Outsider Lens Qualitative studies bring out the lived experiences of research participants. Their narratives provide rich data for a study. Rowe (2014) attests that a researcher’s position in- ﬂuences what they choose to investigate, the manner in which the research is conducted, and how the results are analysed and presented. Therefore, a researcher can be an insider as well as an outsider in the same study as depicted in Figure 1. According toOzano and Khatri (2018),t h ei n s i d e r - outsider position stems fro m how the researchers view themselves and how they are viewed by others. They claim an insider would be someone with power whilst an outsider feels powerless or comes from a privileged or disadvantaged situation (Ozano & Khatri, 2018). Kezar (2002) notes that this could be attributed to our overlapping identities that may inﬂuence the research in some form. As an insider, the re- searcher can have some critical information, but as an out- sider, they may not have prior knowledge of the participants’ lived experiences in the study (A l ie ta l . ,2 0 2 2; Mercer, 2007). As illustrated inFigure 1, the position of a researcher can be both from an insider or an outsider lens. For example, the researcher can be an insider if they belong to the same community as the participants. However, even though they belong to the same community, there could be an age gap or gender differences (Yip, 2024). In the same way,Figure 1 attempts to show the overlaps, the researcher could have lived experiences with participants because they have the same nationality. On the other hand, there could be linguistic di- versity between the researcher and their participants despite belonging to the same country.

Through the perspectives of individuals and the speciﬁcs of their lived experiences, theﬁeld of qualitative research aims to provide insight into an issue (Bourke, 2014, p. 2). Therefore, it is pivotal for research in higher education to bring forth my lived experiences when reﬂecting on my researcher posi- tionality. Another example can be seen when the teacher is conducting research with their own students; this raisesﬂags related to ﬁt their research agenda. According to Bourke (2014) and Holmes (2020) it is critical to explain the un- derlying assumptions of how the student-teacher relation would provide unbiasedﬁndings and conclusions of the study. These assumptions relate to accessibility as a teacher (Bourke, 2014, p. 5). My study beneﬁted from the insights I brought through my identity as both insider and outsider to the research context. When I joined high school, in theﬁrst few weeks, I felt out of place, had culture shock, and I found adapting to English as a mode of communication between teachers and students challenging. There was constant fear of being unaccepted in Figure 1. Qualitative researcher lenses. Note. I have outlined thisﬁgure to demonstrate that a qualitative researcher’s position can be grouped into the insider and outsider lens. Goundar 3 the English-language mediated learning high school envi- ronment. This resonated with the challenges faced by the students who were participants in my study, placing me as a quasi-insider (Goundar, 2023b; 2023d). From an insider’s perspective, I was able to gain access to undergraduate students and understand educational inequalities that persist in different parts of Fiji Islands. Milligan (2016) argues that a researcher cannot be ex- pected to fully be an insider or an outsider but takes on different positions depending on their situation. According to Yip (2024, p. 223), the two positions at play for the re- searcher are not clearly delineated but areﬂuid and situated within a continuum. This also draws on conﬂicting views that exist between the participants and the researcher. For ex- ample, Yip (2024) assumes that she was an insider when conducting a research with Asian immigrant teachers.

According to Yip (2024, p. 223), the two positions at play for the re- searcher are not clearly delineated but areﬂuid and situated within a continuum. This also draws on conﬂicting views that exist between the participants and the researcher. For ex- ample, Yip (2024) assumes that she was an insider when conducting a research with Asian immigrant teachers. While interviewing participants for her doctoral research, Yip re- alised that one of her participants from Bangladesh con- sidered her an outsider as she was not from a Chinese Asian background like her. Factors such as how the researcher perceives to be either an insider or outsider may not nec- essarily play out the same way in theﬁeld. Therefore,Blaikie and Priest (2019) advise researchers to adopt a learner ’s stance by suspending preconceived notions, and engage in understanding participants’ contexts. Beneﬁts of Being an Insider Researchers need to be conscious of their position in relation to the participants under study (Yip, 2024). Positionality in terms of how the participants can beneﬁt from the researcher being an insider is appropriate to include as it provides clarity in identifying the various factors that are encountered in a qualitative research process.Adding to the study’s robustness was my status as an academic and, therefore, as a quasi- insider among the study participants (Goundar, 2023d). Being a quasi-insider, I had familiarity with the culture and lan- guages as a Fiji Islander. More importantly, my status as a local gave the participants an opportunity to engage freely and voice their views without worrying about criticism (Katyal & King, 2014; Milligan, 2016). Being an academic researching his own students and my privileged position as someone who worked for a reputed institution, Green Lantern University, allowed me to reach out to students from all parts of Fiji Islands. This might not have been possible if I was not in academia. Hence, Yip (2024, p. 228) states there are both positives and negatives of insider and outsider positions. Katyal and King (2014)highlight that being an insider may prove to be advantageous as familiarity encourages partici- pants to feel less restrained and more willing to speak. On the contrary, Shah (2004)disputes that familiarity might impose a risk where researchers may assume answers and not probe deeper", "source": "goundar-2025-researcher-positionality-ways-to-include-it-in-a-qualitative-research-design.pdf"}, {"id": 208, "text": "024, p. 228) states there are both positives and negatives of insider and outsider positions.

On the contrary, Shah (2004)disputes that familiarity might impose a risk where researchers may assume answers and not probe deeper into the response. However, due to my position, I had unique insights into making improvements and recommen- dations based onﬁndings relating to academic English written proﬁciency and educational inequalities (Goundar, 2023d). Although this could also be achieved by an outsider, I had the privilege and opportunity to follow through with these rec- ommendations at Green Lantern University. In the above example, cultural acknowledgement is signi ﬁcantly high- lighted when discussing the insider lens. I show the rela- tionship between the research objectives and their signiﬁcance to the institution where the study was conducted. Masters, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Social Work, Doctor of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, and Ph.D. candidates carrying out research in their own institutions can take a similar approach. Researcher’s Educational Background Another way to depict the outsider context is by acknowl- edging the educational background of the researcher. To il- lustrate, I was both an insider and an outsider in the context of being a Fiji Islander and my cultural background. I belonged to some part(s) of the country, but I am an outsider in others. For instance, my primary and secondary education took place in a semi-urban part of the western region of Fiji Island. This restricted any ontological assumptions I may have made, as I did not have the same background knowledge as the partic- ipants in my project ( Goundar, 2023d), who came from various urban, rural and island schools. In such a context, I was effectively an outsider in terms of cultural and education background (Goundar, 2023d). I point out the educational background as factors that attribute to the outsider lens. This is pivotal to a study as it goes on to provide insights that would be relatively new for theﬁeld (Holmes, 2020). These insights can include ﬁndings that the investigator might not have anticipated. Further, the insights I have provided in this paper may not have bee", "source": "goundar-2025-researcher-positionality-ways-to-include-it-in-a-qualitative-research-design.pdf"}, {"id": 209, "text": "nd education background (Goundar, 2023d). I point out the educational background as factors that attribute to the outsider lens. This is pivotal to a study as it goes on to provide insights that would be relatively new for theﬁeld (Holmes, 2020). These insights can include ﬁndings that the investigator might not have anticipated. Further, the insights I have provided in this paper may not have been noted in the existing literature as well. Even reli- gious backgrounds can provide insights into where a re- searcher is considered an outsider ( Sanghera & Thapar- Bj¨orkert, 2008). An individual’s values and beliefs are sha- ped by their political allegiance, religious faith, gender, sexuality, historical and geographical location, ethnicity, race, social class, and status (Holmes, 2020; Lowndes et al., 2017). Being an outsider to these factors can be intuitive. For ex- ample, I attended multicultural schools where all religions were accorded the same status. However, some of the par- ticipants in my study attended religious faith-based education institutions. Hence, insights into the way teaching and learning took place in those settings would be different from my own experience. Gender Consideration The other signiﬁcant factor as an outsider relates to gender (Bourke, 2014) which plays a pivotal role in how the study is informed from various perspectives. For instance, 4 International Journal of Qualitative Methods earlier in this paper, it was pointed out that I am a male whereas most of the participants in my study were fe- males. Therefore, in my thesis I provided clarity on po- sitionality in relation to gender using the outsider lens. I am an adult male academic who wanted to investigate issues impacting young people who were not of my generation or age group. This put me in an outsider ’s position as I did not have the participants’ lived experi- ences. Moreover, as a male I lacked insight into the way education is viewed and experienced by female students. I could not assume that the issues faced by males and fe- males in Fiji Islands were the same. Due to my gender, my status was that of an outsider for female participants in the study (Goundar, 2023d ). Since I was a male, I lacked the lived experiences of female pa rticipants. Therefore, the experiences of female participants gave more insight to my research. According to Bourke (2014), the research ", "source": "goundar-2025-researcher-positionality-ways-to-include-it-in-a-qualitative-research-design.pdf"}, {"id": 210, "text": "uld not assume that the issues faced by males and fe- males in Fiji Islands were the same.

Therefore, the experiences of female participants gave more insight to my research. According to Bourke (2014), the research interest of a researcher is the lived experiences of the participants. Like the example on the educational background of the researcher, the gender factor in the preceding example provides clarity on the outsider lens. One of the elements that I did not account for was those participants who did not identify as a male or female including those who would have preferred not to say anything about their gender. Those who did not identify as a male or female would have had a different lived experience with Fiji’s educational system. My study (Goundar, 2023c) could have beneﬁtted from their insights as that would have contributed to the recommendations of language education policies in the study. Balance of Power Dhillon and Thomas (2019) sate that a researcher’sp o s i - tionality is multidimensional and inﬂuenced by the power rela- tions between the researchers and their participants. Since the power dynamics are subject to questioning, a researcher should be precise in their positionality when explaining how the balance of power between the researcher and participants play out. Clari- fying this in earlier stages of the study will leave less room for any form of dominance between the parties. The following example illustrates how balance of power can be framed in a thesis:During the data collection stages of my project, my status was that of a doctoral researcher from the Howard State University (Goundar, 2023d). I was aware that the students knew me as one of their lecturers and that relationship does not automatically disappear. However, to make the students comfortable with my position as a doctoral candidate, two strategies were used.First, I carried out informal chats and casual talks during the students’ breaks. This helped the participants to be at ease with me and ask questions about the research without hesitation (Yip, 2024). I also explained to them that participation was on a voluntary basis which assured them of no obligations towards me or the research. I", "source": "goundar-2025-researcher-positionality-ways-to-include-it-in-a-qualitative-research-design.pdf"}, {"id": 211, "text": " my position as a doctoral candidate, two strategies were used.First, I carried out informal chats and casual talks during the students’ breaks. This helped the participants to be at ease with me and ask questions about the research without hesitation (Yip, 2024). I also explained to them that participation was on a voluntary basis which assured them of no obligations towards me or the research. I positioned myself as an outsider, and the study participants were not students who I directly taught but from the university I worked at. The relationship between the researcher and the participant is a legitimate factor (Yip, 2024). For example, some par- ticipants in the doctoral research conducted byYip (2024) engaged in her study out of goodwill and personal reasons. One of her participants was a mutual acquaintance while another participant was interested in her workplace which were some of the reasons for participation. The participants in my study were informed that they could leave the study at any point in time. Leaving the study would not subject them to being treated unfairly. However, none of the participants left the longitudinal study during the one year of data collection (Goundar, 2023d). Here, the researcher speciﬁed how the balance of power came into place during the data collection phase. This also illustrated the point that a researcher’s po- sition from the commencement of qualitative research until its completion needs to be declared in different stages. For in- stance, the reﬂections show the data collection process, sig- nifying how to recruit participants but allowing the individuals full power so that the data is not inﬂuenced (Ozano & Khatri, 2018; Wilson et al., 2022). Giving liberty to the participants created an open environment of comfort for involvement (Blaikie & Priest, 2019). They did not feel pressured or ob- liged to participate in the study just because I was an academic at the same institution they were studying at. Another point to consider when demonstrating balance of power in the researcher’s positionality is to reﬂect how one’s environment impacts the study (Dhillon & Thomas, 2019; Wilson et al., 2022). The research should provide the current situation whether it has to do with geographical features or age gaps. For instance, various developments had taken place in Fiji’s education system since I was a primary and seconda", "source": "goundar-2025-researcher-positionality-ways-to-include-it-in-a-qualitative-research-design.pdf"}, {"id": 212, "text": "onsider when demonstrating balance of power in the researcher’s positionality is to reﬂect how one’s environment impacts the study (Dhillon & Thomas, 2019; Wilson et al., 2022). The research should provide the current situation whether it has to do with geographical features or age gaps. For instance, various developments had taken place in Fiji’s education system since I was a primary and secondary school student. Thus, my participants had a better grasp of the contemporary practice and conditions of teaching and learning in the country. The participants had more power as they carried knowledge about education system in rural areas and islands. Signiﬁcantly, they had age-speciﬁci n - sights since they were from a different generation (Goundar, 2023d). This example identiﬁes how the participants had more power over the research in terms of the rich data. In her reﬂection Yip (2024, p. 229) also echoes this notion of“balance of power” by claiming that while she possessed the information about the study, her participants owned the knowledge and experience for the study. Limitations As I reﬂect on the study I carried out as a Ph.D. scholar between 2020 to 2023, I realise that perhaps I could have recruited more participants through my network or contacts. These would have been colleagues in other departments or based in other campuses who could have assisted during the recruitment stage. However, that means additional time would have been needed to be put in to do the data analysis, tran- scribing interviews, and collating the language test results. I also believe that students might have felt that they would get in my good books if they participated in my study under the assumption that they would be in my courses in future.Bourke Goundar 5 (2014, p. 7) argues that his positionality as a researcher is not a limitation to the study but meets the positionality of the participants. He points out that the research one engages in is shaped by who the person is. As long as one remains reﬂective throughout the research process, an individual will be shaped by it and the people they interact with (Bourke, 2014,p .7 ; Yip, 2024). Being a novice researcher the concept of‘researcher posi- tionality’ was unfamiliar to me prior to undertaking a higher degree by research. Even though I had conducted qualitative research previously,positionality was not considered. Therefore", "source": "goundar-2025-researcher-positionality-ways-to-include-it-in-a-qualitative-research-design.pdf"}, {"id": 213, "text": "one remains reﬂective throughout the research process, an individual will be shaped by it and the people they interact with (Bourke, 2014,p .7 ; Yip, 2024).

Even though I had conducted qualitative research previously,positionality was not considered. Therefore, I am aware that some of the reﬂections that should have been made regarding the various positions I have might not have been fully acknowledged. These multiple positions can relate to the insider- outsider disclosure, the balance of power or an oversight of a crucial factor as well (Herod, 1999). As Holmes (2020,p .8 ) notes, engaging in reﬂexive practise by articulating ones posi- tionality does not guarantee the research to be of higher quality. It does however indicate that reﬂexivity should assist in becoming a better researcher (Holmes, 2020, p. 8). I do believe that despite the limitations of my study, through reﬂections, I will be able to improve on my research designs in future undertakings. Conclusion This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on qualitative research design that explores positionality. The key assertion that Masters, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Social Work, Doctor of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, and Ph.D. candidates ought to frame in a section of their thesis should include a discussion about the researcher’s positionality, the ways in which they are to be seen as an insider or an outsider in the study. There should be a discussion on the power dynamics between the researcher and their participants (Katyal & King, 2014). Researcher positionality isa way to safeguard against any partiality that can be questioned at the conclusion of a study (Wilson et al., 2022). Therefore, researchers ought to have an open mind when conducting a study. They need to account for these factors by maintaining the different positions that provide insights into the research. While recruiting participants, I engaged in informal conversations during breaks at the university with potential participants. This stems as a form of trust building exercise.Yip (2024,p .2 3 0 )c o nﬁrms it is critical to build trust and rapport which allow for interactions toﬂow naturally rather than being strictly guided by pre-determined questions.

At the beginning of this paper, I clariﬁed that this article provides a practical approach to the concept of researcher posi- tionality rather than a theoretical stand. When my supervisors introduced me to this approach, I was not sure if I could do justice as it was a relatively new concept. However, in qualitative research designs, we need to be speciﬁc in clarifying our position in a study (Holmes, 2020). The concepts, as well as how each of these have been depicted in this paper, provide some promising practices to help when novice researchers account for positionality in their own work. There are ways of navigating this task which I h a v ea t t e m p t e dt oi l l u s t r a t ei nt h i sp a p e rb yd r a w i n go ne x a m p l e s from my Ph.D. thesis. Future research could investigate how higher degree researchers use‘researcher positionality’ beyond their dissertation and assess their conﬁdence of employing it in the research process. Acknowledgments I would like to acknowledge my Ph.D. supervisors; Associate Pro- fessor Finex Ndhlovu and Dr. Arvind Iyengar from the School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, at the University of New England, New South Wales, Australia. At the eleventh hour of my thesis submission, they brought the concepts discussed in this paper which allowed me to reﬂect on how I carried out the research project. I have always credited Finex for taking Ph.D. candidates out of their comfort zone and making them think. Writing the researcher posi- tionality was precisely that. I thank Dr. Iyengar for putting across stimulating questions in making the discussion of positionality meticulous in the introductory chapter of my thesis.

The arguments for a participatory worldview are articulated based on a subjective-objective ontology; an extended epistemology of experiential, presenta- tional, propositional, and practical ways of knowing; a methodology based on cooperative relations between coresearchers; and an axiology that affirms the primary value of practical knowing in the service of human flourishing. INTRODUCTION The notion of a paradigm or worldview as an overarching framework that organizes our whole approach to being in the world has become common- place since Kuhn published The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962. In contrast to the view that a paradigm is, by its very nature, beyond definition and the grasp of the human mind, we believe that the mind, by its very nature, is more extensive than any worldview on which it takes its current cognitive stance. Hence, it is possible and essential to expand our awareness to articu- late any fundamental way in which we frame our world, for differences of epistemology, methodology, and political perspective are usually based on paradigmatic assumptions. Although paradigms can be sketched out in simple cognitive terms, their nature is far richer. As Ogilvy (1986) pointed out, they are about &dquo;models, myths, moods and metaphors&dquo; (p. 48). Guba and Lincoln (1994) made a very useful contribution to articulating and differentiating competing paradigms of inquiry. They identified and Authors’ Note: The authors wish to thank Yvonna Lincoln and an anonymous QI reviewer for their helpful comments.

In this article, we argue that the constructivist paradigm, as they articulate it, is unclear about the relationship between constructed realities and the original givenness of the cosmos, and that a worldview based on participation and participative realities is more helpful and satisfying. We start from and extend the Guba and Lincoln framework to articulate a participatory paradigm. We argue that a fundamental quality of the participative worldview, which it shares with Guba and Lincoln’s constructivism, is that it is self-reflexive. The participative mind-which Heron (1996) also termed the postconceptual mind-articulates reality within a paradigm, articulates the paradigm itself, and can in principle reach out to the wider context of that paradigm to reframe it. A basic problem of positivist mind is that it cannot acknowledge the framing paradigm it has created. It confuses the given cosmos with the worldview it has generated to shape the given. It cannot see that the ground, on which it stands to frame its world, is its own creation. It thus tends toward immodesty, intolerance, and the oppression of scientism. The most extreme rejection of positivism is that form of postmortem poststructuralism, derived from the deconstruction of Derrida (1976, 1981), which holds that there are no transcendental grounds for truth outside the text. Its basic problem is that it dismisses any ground as valid simply because there is another ground or context beyond it. It confuses relative truth with nihilistic skepticism; it thinks that because no ground is final, no ground has any claim to truth. It thus tends toward a restless anarchy of raw, purposeless power. The case for a participative worldview has underpinned our work on cooperative inquiry and other participative forms of action research over the past 20 years and more. We have articulated this perspective as an epistemo- logical and political principle more recently (Heron, 1996; Reason & Heron, 1995). In parallel with this, other writers have developed arguments that include a participative perspective (Berman, 1981; Tarnas, 1991; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1993), whereas Skolimowski (1994) developed the per- spective he terms the participatory mind.

A particularly elegant elucidation of participatory perception and language and its implications for ecological thinking can be found in Abram (1996). Although our articulation in this article of a participatory worldview is necessarily expressed in propositional language, we wish to at least point toward the sense of resolution and meaning, of joy and beauty, the image of participation brings to us personally The image shows us how to move away from the mechanical abstraction of the Cartesian worldview, and from the relativism that appears first as its counterpoint, to an experience of participa- tory reality. The participatory worldview allows us as human persons to know that we are part of the whole rather than separated as mind over and against matter, or placed here in the relatively separate creation of a transcen- dent god. It allows us to join with fellow humans in collaborative forms of 276 inquiry. It places us back in relation with the living world-and we note that to be in relation means that we live with the rest of creation as relatives, with all the rights and obligations that implies (Storm, 1972, 1994). Our warrant, therefore, for the choice and assertion of a participatory worldview is fundamentally experiential. Our work with cooperative inquiry, in mindfulness practices and ceremony, and our attempts at aware everyday living all convince us that experiential encounter with the presence of the world is the ground of our being and knowing. This encounter is prior to language and art-although it can be symbolized in language and art. Our experience is that our meeting with the elemental properties of the living world, or the I-thou encounter with a living tree or person, cannot be confused with our symbolic constructs. In terms we use later in the article, while propositional and presentational knowledge are grounded on and symbolize experiential knowledge, experiential knowledge cannot be reduced to either of them.

This, we argue, is not a dissociated metaphysical statement; rather, it is an expression of a radical empiricism that can be tested through experi- ential inquiry, and we invite others, both skeptical and sympathetic, to inquire with us as to the validity of our perspective. This form of radical empiricism is not to be confused with behaviorism, which has never been empirical enough, because it preconceives and delimits experience in terms of its positivist paradigm. On the contrary, our empiricism is the radical sort long since commended by phenomenologists; a pristine acquaintance with phenomena unadulterated by preconceptions (Spiegel- berg, 1960). It is unrestricted experience of the &dquo;lived-through world,&dquo; which Merleau-Ponty insisted is misrepresented and distorted by the limiting can- ons of the &dquo;objective thought&dquo; of positivist science and &dquo;dogmatic common sense&dquo; (Merleau-Ponty, 1962; Hammond, Howarth, & Keat, 1991). We think it important to reclaim the notion of empiricism from positivist abuse and restore it to more fruitful use in terms of this kind of liberated experience (Heron, 1996). The empirical is based on experience, and it ceases to be empirical when experience is constrained by a restricting definition. THE NATURE OF INQUIRY PARADIGMS Guba and Lincoln argued that inquiry paradigms may be viewed as sets of basic beliefs about the nature of reality and how it may be known; and that these beliefs are thrown into relief by three fundamental and interrelated questions. There is the ontological question, &dquo;What is the form and nature of reality and, therefore, what is there than can be known about it?&dquo;; the epistemological question, &dquo;What is the relationship between the knower or would-be knower and what can be known&dquo;; and the methodological ques- tion, &dquo;How can the inquirer ... go about finding out whatever he or she believes can be known about?&dquo; 277 Guba and Lincoln began by identifying the responses proponents of the four different paradigms would make to the three questions identified above.

These response are given in Figure 1, the first five columns of which are taken directly from Guba and Lincoln. The final Participatory column is our addi- tion. We also added a fourth row, Axiology, which is omitted from the Guba and Lincoln account, and which we think is an essential defining charac- teristic of an inquiry paradigm, alongside ontology, epistemology, and meth- odology. The axiological question asks what is intrinsically valuable in human life, in particular what sort of knowledge, if any, is intrinsically valuable. This is discussed in a later section. We will not go into the details of Guba and Lincoln’s analysis; rather, we will concentrate on identifying our problems with the constructivist world- view that they espouse and articulating a participative worldview. We understand from Guba and Lincoln (1989) that the real is a mental construct of individuals, and such constructs &dquo;do not exist outside of the persons who create and hold them&dquo; (p. 143). Thus, there can be many such constructed realities; and they may be conflicting and incompatible. Con- structions are not more or less &dquo;true&dquo;; rather, they are more or less sophisti- cated and informed. As Heron (1996) argued: There is an immediate difficulty with the idea that reality is a construction within an individual mind. It raises the problem of solipsism, which is an ironic problemfor a science of the Other. For if reality is nothing but an internal mental construct, no warrant can be given for supposing that the other people being studied actually exist, let alone for supposing that the researcher’s view of them ade- quately represents their own view of their situation. However, Guba and Lincoln are ambiguous in their account of constructivism. They also say that the mental constructions are related to &dquo;tangible entities&dquo;, which would thus appear to have some reality independent of the constructions (Schwandt, 1994: 134).

So their explicit idealist stance seems to rest on an implicit realism, and leaves the paradigm in a state of wobble. (p. 10) Constructivist views tend to be deficient in any acknowledgment of expe- riential knowing; that is, knowing by acquaintance, by meeting, and by felt participation in the presence of what is there. Von Glasersfeld thought we cannot in any way know a &dquo;real&dquo; world, and cannot even imagine it, because we cannot conceive of anything existing without the notions of space and time, which are our own constructs (von Glasersfeld, 1991, p. 17). This is the Kantian view that space and time are a priori forms that the mind imposes on reality, nothing to do with reality itself. But Kant only laid hold of the mind as making the world through conceptual constructs. He did not grasp that the mind is also meeting given reality through participating in its being, and that the mind makes its world by meeting the given. Thus, we take the view that the mind’s conceptual articulation of the world is grounded in its experiential participation in what is present, in what there is. This statement is open to misunderstanding without further elaboration. 278 The constructivist and participatory paradigms are in agreement that it is not possible in linguistic, conceptual terms to give any final or absolute account of what there is. Propositional knowing can only give mediated-subjective and intersubjective-relativistic accounts. The participatory paradigm goes fur- ther and asserts that we cannot have any final or absolute experiential knowing of what there is; in the relation of knowing by acquaintance, the experiential knower shapes perceptually what is there. And this is still so when the perceiving mind is relatively free of conceptual labels imposed on its imaging of reality. However, the point about experiential knowing is that the very process of perceiving is also a meeting, a transaction, with what there is.

And this is still so when the perceiving mind is relatively free of conceptual labels imposed on its imaging of reality. However, the point about experiential knowing is that the very process of perceiving is also a meeting, a transaction, with what there is. When I hold your hand, my tactual imaging both subjectively shapes you and objectively meets you. To encounter being or a being is both to image it in my way and to know that it is there. To experience anything is to participate in it, and to participate is both to mold and to encounter; hence, experiential reality is always subjective-objective. There is an analog here with Rahner’s modem theology of revelation, in which he spoke paradoxically of &dquo;mediated-immediacy&dquo;: we experience divine presence always in mediated form (Dulles, 1992). Experiential knowing is subjective-objective and so relative to the knower. It is also relative to the given cosmos, but with greater immediacy, lesser mediation, than propositional knowing. Experiential knowing is thus a ground, albeit not an absolute ground, for the symbolic frameworks of conceptual, propositional knowing. Constructivists Guba and Lincoln ac- knowledge, as the citation above states, that conceptual constructs are related to &dquo;tangible entities&dquo; and thus appear to accept tangible or experiential knowing. They do not, however, articulate the nature of experiential knowing and do not regard it as providing any kind of warrant for the valid use of conceptual constructs; hence our statement earlier that constructivist views tend to be deficient in any acknowledgment of it. Thus, Gergen (1986) reduced reality to an intersubjective social construc- tion generated by collective language use and other social practices. Such social constructions have no independently identifiable real-world referents (p. 143). Both von Glasersfeld and Gergen are so busy rejecting the idea of an independent, objective world as the absolute ground of conceptual knowl- edge claims that they overlook the idea of an experiential subjective-objective world as the relative ground of such claims.

THE PARTICIPATORY WORLDVIEW It is this idea of subjective-objective reality that launches our response to Guba and Lincoln’s three questions from the perspective of the participative worldview. 279 Ontology: Subjective-Objective There is a given cosmos, a primordial reality, in which the mind actively participates. Mind and the given cosmos are engaged in a cocreative dance, so that what emerges as reality is the fruit of an interaction of the given cosmos and the way mind engages with it. Mind actively participates in the cosmos, and it is through this active participation that we meet what is Other: &dquo;Worlds and people are what we meet, but the meeting is shaped by our own terms of reference&dquo; (Heron, 1996, p. 11). The skeptic may ask how we can know we meet anything or anyone if the meeting is always given our own shape. The answer is that when we open ourselves to meeting the given we are arrested by the presence of Other; or to put it another way, the Other declares itself to us so that we resonate with its presence in the world. Abram (1996) made a similar point and showed that it not only includes Husserl’s point that the field of appearances is &dquo;seen to be inhabited by multiple subjectivities ... by other experiencing subjects as well as by oneself’ (p. 37; emphasis in original); it also embraces the view of Merleau-Ponty (1962), who took Husserl’s argument a stage further, showing how perception itself is participatory so that in so far as my hand knows hardness and softness, and my gaze knows the moon’s light, It is as a certain way of linking up with the phenomena and communicating with it. Hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, moonlight and sunlight, present themselves in our recollection not pre-emi- nently as sensory contents but as certain kinds of symbioses, certain ways the outside has of invading us and certain ways we have of meeting the invasion. (p. 317) According to Abram (1996), this means that there is &dquo;underneath our literate abstractions, a deeply participatory relation to things and to the earth, a felt reciprocity&dquo; (p. 124).

This encounter is transactional, interactive; to touch, see, or hear some- thing or someone does not tell us either about our self all on its own or about a being out there all on its own. It tells us about a being in a state of interrelation and copresence with us. Our subjectivity feels the participation of what is there and is illuminated by it. Knowing a world is in this felt relation at the interactive interface between a subject and what is encountered. In the relation of meeting, my subjectivity becomes a perspectival window filled with a world that also transcends it. This ontology is thus subjective-objective: It is subjective because it is only known through the form the mind gives it; and it is objective because the mind interpenetrates the given cosmos which it shapes. (Heron, 1996, p. 11) Or, as Skolimowski (1994) put it, 280 Things become what our consciousness makes of them through the active participation of our mind. (pp. 27-28) The cosmos or the universe is a primordial ontological datum, while the &dquo;world&dquo; is an epistemological construct, a form of our understanding. (p. 100) Bateson made the point that between the extremes of solipsism, in which &dquo;I make it all up,&dquo; and a purely external reality in which I cease to exist, there is a region where you are partly blown by the winds of reality and partly an artist creating a composite out of inner and outer events. (cited in Brockman, 1977, p. 245) From all this it follows that what can be known about the given cosmos is that it is always known as a subjectively articulated world, whose objectivity is relative to how it is shaped by the knower. But this is not all; its objectivity is also relative to how it is intersubjectively shaped. For there is the important if obvious point that knowers can only be knowers when known by other knowers. Knowing presupposes mutual participative awareness. It presup- poses participation, through meeting and dialogue, in a culture of shared art and shared language, shared values, norms, and beliefs. And, deeper still, agreement about the rules", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm (1).pdf"}, {"id": 228, "text": "also relative to how it is intersubjectively shaped.

And, deeper still, agreement about the rules of language, about how to use it, presupposes a tacit mutual experiential knowing and understanding between people that is the primary ground of all explicit forms of knowing. So any subjective- objective reality articulated by any one person is done so within an intersub- jective field, a context of both linguistic-cultural and experiential shared meanings. Epistemology: Critical Subjectivity and Four Ways of Knowing A participative worldview, with its notion of reality as subjective-objective, involves an extended epistemology. A knower participates in the known, articulates a world, in at least four interdependent ways: experiential, presen- tational, propositional, and practical. These four forms of knowing constitute the manifold of our subjectivity, within which, it seems, we have enormous latitude both in acknowledging its components and in using them in associa- tion with, or dissociation from, each other. This epistemology presents us as knowers with an interesting developmental challenge. We call this challenge critical subjectivity. It involves an awareness of the four ways of knowing, of how they are currently interacting, and of ways of changing the relations between them so that they articulate a reality that is unclouded by a restrictive and ill-disciplined subjectivity. Experiential knowing means direct encounter, face-to-face meeting: feel- ing and imaging the presence of some energy, entity, person, place, process, 281 or thing. It is knowing through participative, empathic resonance with a being, so that as knower I feel both attuned with it and distinct from it. It is also the creative shaping of a world through the transaction of imaging it, perceptually and in other ways. Experiential knowing thus articulates reality through inner resonance with what there is and through perceptually enact- ing (Varela et al., 1993) its forms of appearing.

It is also the creative shaping of a world through the transaction of imaging it, perceptually and in other ways. Experiential knowing thus articulates reality through inner resonance with what there is and through perceptually enact- ing (Varela et al., 1993) its forms of appearing. Presentational knowing emerges from and is grounded in experiential knowing. It is evident in an intuitive grasp of the significance of our resonance with and imaging of our world as this grasp is symbolized in graphic, plastic, musical, vocal, and verbal art forms. It clothes our experiential knowing of the world in the metaphors of aesthetic creation, in expressive spatiotemporal forms of imagery. These forms symbolize both our felt attunement with the world and the primary meaning embedded in our enactment of its appearing. Propositional knowing is knowing in conceptual terms that something is the case; knowledge by description of some energy, entity person, place, process, or thing. It is expressed in statements and theories that come with the mastery of concepts and classes that language bestows. Propositions themselves are carried by presentational forms-the sounds or visual shapes of the spoken or written word-and are ultimately grounded in our experi- ential articulation of a world. Practical knowing is knowing how to do something, demonstrated in a skill or competence. We would argue that practical knowledge is in an important sense primary (Heron, 1996). It presupposes a conceptual grasp of principles and standards of practice, presentational elegance, and experiential grounding in the situation within which the action occurs. It fulfills the three prior forms of knowing, brings them to fruition in purposive deeds, and consummates them with its autonomous celebration of excellent accomplishment. As Macmurray (1957) pointed out, although you can divorce thought from action, you cannot divorce action in the world from thought. And we believe that what we learn about our world will be richer and deeper if this descrip- tive knowledge is incidental to a primary intention to develop practical skills to change the world. This is the action paradox: We learn more profoundly about our worlds when we are more interested in enhancing them with excellence of action than in learning about them.

This is the action paradox: We learn more profoundly about our worlds when we are more interested in enhancing them with excellence of action than in learning about them. (Heron, 1996, p. 114) Torbert (1991, p. 221) underlined the preeminence of practical knowing with his view that what we need is an action inquiry useful to the actor and the point of action rather than a reflective science about action. His account of action inquiry is that a person is conscious in the midst of action, seeing and correcting, on-line, incongruities among the goal of the action and wider purposes within which it is nested, the strategic means, the immediate 282 Figure 1 behavior, and outcomes in the world. This, he holds, is a holistic and inclusive inquiry paradigm. It is equally important that action not only consummates the prior forms of knowing but is grounded in them. It is in this congruence of the four aspects of the extended epistemology that lie claims to validity (this relationship is shown in Figure 1). Critical subjectivity means that we attend both to the grounding relations between the forms of knowing and to their consummating relations. Thus, it is a close relative of Torbert’s (1991) &dquo;consciousness in the midst of action&dquo; (p. 221). Critical subjectivity is a state of consciousness different from either the naive subjectivity of &dquo;primary process&dquo; awareness or the attempted objectivity of egoic &dquo;secondary process&dquo; awareness. It means that we do not suppress our primary subjective experience but accept that it is our experien- tial articulation of being in a world, and as such is the ground of all our knowing. At the same time, we accept that, naively exercised, it is open to all the distortions of those defensive processes by which people collude to limit their understanding. So we attend to it with a critical consciousness, seeking to bring it into aware relation with the other three ways of knowing so that they clarify and refine and elevate it at the same time as being more adequately grounded in it. In addition, because we accept that our knowing is from a perspective and that we are aware of that perspective-of its authentic value and of its restricting bias-we articulate this", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm (1).pdf"}, {"id": 231, "text": "to it with a critical consciousness, seeking to bring it into aware relation with the other three ways of knowing so that they clarify and refine and elevate it at the same time as being more adequately grounded in it.

Critical subjectivity involves a self-reflexive attention to the ground on which one is standing. This is echoed in what Torbert (1987) called &dquo;a refraining mind&dquo; that &dquo;continually overcomes itself, divesting itself of its own presuppositions&dquo; 283 (p. 211). It is related to what Bateson (1972) described as Learning III, in which the mind can choose its premises of understanding and action, can detach itself from all frameworks to peer into and reflect on their presuppositions. It is Kegan’s (1994) transparadigmatic fourth-order consciousness and Gebser’s (1985) integral-aperspectival mind which grasps that no perspective is final, is transparent to the context of its own operation, is open to the context of that context, and so on. It also relates to those moderate postmortem poststructu- ralists who do not deny truth and meaning as such, but hold that all truth and meaning are relative to a context, and that context is boundless, infinitely extendable (Culler, 1982). The constructivism of Guba and Lincoln (1989) holds that standards for determining what is relatively true reside in community consensus. What the participatory paradigm adds to this is the view that any conceptual context is itself set within a wider and deeper experiential context. Propositional truth is not only relative to the linguistic and conceptual context of the community in which it is uttered. It is also relative to the substrate of shared experiential primary meaning, which is the contextual ground for the use of language and conceptual exchange within the community (Heron, 1996). Thus, critical subjectivity extends to critical intersubjectivity Because our personal knowing is always set within a context of both linguist-cultural and experiential shared meaning, having a critical consciousness about our know- ing necessarily includes shared experience, dialogue, feedback, and exchange with others, and this leads us to the methodology of ", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm (1).pdf"}, {"id": 232, "text": " within the community (Heron, 1996). Thus, critical subjectivity extends to critical intersubjectivity Because our personal knowing is always set within a context of both linguist-cultural and experiential shared meaning, having a critical consciousness about our know- ing necessarily includes shared experience, dialogue, feedback, and exchange with others, and this leads us to the methodology of cooperative inquiry. Methodology: Collaborative Forms of Action Inquiry Inquiry methodology within a participative worldview needs to be one that draws on this extended epistemology in such a way that critical subjec- tivity is enhanced by critical intersubjectivity; hence, a collaborative form of inquiry, in which all involved engage together in democratic dialogue as coresearchers and as cosubjects (Heron, 1996; Reason & Heron, 1995). In our articulation of this, which we call cooperative inquiry, people collaborate to define the questions they wish to explore and the methodology for that exploration (propositional knowing). Together or separately they apply this methodology in the world of their practice (practical knowing), which leads to new forms of encounter with their world (experiential knowing); and they find ways to represent this experience in significant patterns (presentational knowing), which feeds into a revised propositional understanding of the originating questions. Thus, coresearchers engage together in cycling several times through the four forms of knowing to enrich their congruence; that is, to refine the way they elevate and consummate each other, and to deepen the complementary way they are grounded in each other. 284 Research cycling is itself a fundamental discipline that leads toward critical subjectivity and a primary way of enhancing the validity of inquirers’ claims to articulate a subjective-objective reality. There is also a range of further procedures that develop this effect. These include managing divergence and convergence within and between cycles, balancing reflection and action, challenging uncritical subjectivity and intersubjectivity, managing unaware projections and displaced anxiety, attending to the dynamic interplay of chaos and order, and securing authentic collaboration (for a full discussion of these, together with a set of radical skills of being and doing required during the action phases of the inquiry, see Heron, ", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm (1).pdf"}, {"id": 233, "text": "ween cycles, balancing reflection and action, challenging uncritical subjectivity and intersubjectivity, managing unaware projections and displaced anxiety, attending to the dynamic interplay of chaos and order, and securing authentic collaboration (for a full discussion of these, together with a set of radical skills of being and doing required during the action phases of the inquiry, see Heron, 1996). Although cooperative inquiry has formed the basis of our theorizing and practice, we see it as closely related to other forms of participative inquiry such as action science (Argyris, Putnam, & Smith, 1985; Argyris & Schon, 1974; Schon, 1983), action inquiry (Torbert, 1991), participatory action research (Fals-Borda & Rahman, 1991), some forms of feminist inquiry (Mies, 1993; Olesen, 1994), emancipatory action research (Carr & Kemmis, 1986), appre- ciative inquiry (Cooperrider and Srivastva, 1987), fourth-generation evalu- ation (Guba & Lincoln, 1989), intervention research (Fryer & Feather, 1994), action research as democratic dialogue (Toulmin & Gustavsen) 1996), and others. Fals-Borda and Rahman (1991) reported that some 35 varieties of participative action inquiry have been identified worldwide. Cooperative inquiry rests on two participatory principles: epistemic par- ticipation and political participation. The first means that any propositional knowledge that is the outcome of the research is grounded by the researchers in their own experiential knowledge. The second means that research subjects have a basic human right to participate fully in designing the research that intends to gather knowledge about them. It follows from the first principle that the researchers are also the subjects; and from the second principle that the subjects are also the researchers. The coresearchers are also the cosubjects. The research is done by people with each other, not by researchers on other people or about them. In mainline qualitative research, done within the aegis of constructivism, neither of these two principles applies. Such research, using multiple meth- odologies, is about other people studied in their own social setting and understood in terms of the meanings those people themselves bring to their situation (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994, p. 2).

The researchers are not also subjects. They ground their propositional findings not on their own experiential knowing but on that of other people, the researched subjects, as reflected in the subjects’ dialogue with the researchers. The researchers’ own experiential knowing as occasional participant observers within the subjects’ culture tend to be secondary and subordinate. Moreover, this kind of analysis is not one constructivist researchers would use, since constructivism does not have any identified epistemological role in its inquiry paradigm for experiential know- ing. The principle of epistemic participation is not acknowledged. 285 Nor does the principle of political participation apply. Mainline qualitative research has not grasped the right of informants to participate in formulating the research design, so that they can manifest fully their values in the way knowledge about them is generated. The great majority of its projects are still unilaterally shaped by the researchers, however emergent that shape may be, however much informed consent is sought, and however much the re- searchers may be concerned to check their findings with informants’ views. Recent texts for graduate students on qualitative research design, which claim constructivist lineage, make no provision of any kind for the inclusion of subjects or informants in design decisions; nor is the issue of such participa- tion anywhere discussed (Creswell, 1994; Erlandson, Harris, Skipper, & Allen, 1993; Marshall & Rossman, 1995). It is important, however, to acknowledge that within the whole field of qualitative research, there are methodologies that involve subjects in design issues, and several of these have been mentioned above. Denzin and Lincoln (1994) have drawn our attention to the crisis of legitimation in qualitative research, which asks by what right researchers claim to speak for the people they have studied.

Denzin and Lincoln (1994) have drawn our attention to the crisis of legitimation in qualitative research, which asks by what right researchers claim to speak for the people they have studied. Lincoln (1997) took this question further, asking &dquo;How do we go about sharing authority for a text with the people who have the authority to tell us about their lives and to make those lives make sense to us?&dquo; Once we acknowledge the need to collaborate, how do we negotiate how the findings will be used? If I’m going to collaborate with people and I’m really going to live up to that commitment, I can’t just write a report all by myself. If we generate a report together, we decide together how it’s going to be used. (Lincoln, 1997, p. 9) It is also important, in discussing this overlap between cooperative inquiry and other forms of participative research, to distinguish between the democ- ratization of content, which involves all informants in decisions about what the research is seeking to find out and achieve; and the democratization of method, which involves participants in decisions about what operational methods are being used, including those being used to democratize the content. The overlap is usually restricted to democratization of research content. It is rare to find any full-blown commitment to collaboration about research method, although Guba and Lincoln strongly commend it (see below). In practice, it may be reduced to no more than seeking fully informed consent of all informants to the researcher’s preexistent or emerging opera- tional plan, and to modifying the plan to obtain such consent. Qualitative research about people is a halfway house between exclusive, controlling, quantitative, positivist research on people and fully participatory, cooperative research with people. The more it involves subjects in the full range of issues involved in research decision making, not only about content issues but also about operational methods, and the more fully researchers participate in the cultures they are studying, the more it shifts in the direction 286 of cooperative inquiry.

The evaluator must share control, however much that appears to threaten the &dquo;technical adequacy&dquo; of the evaluation. That is, the evaluator must solicit and honour stakeholder inputs not only about the substance of constructions but also with respect to the methodology of the evalu- ation itself. (p. 260) Finally, qualitative research is a social science about other people in their own social setting, whereas cooperative inquiry is a wide-ranging science about any aspect of the human condition that a group of coresearchers choose to explore through the instrumentality of their own experience. It certainly includes important social topics, such as revisioning social roles, professional practice, and organizational life. It also includes innumerable others, such as art as a mode of knowledge, intentional self-healing, participative knowledge of organic and inorganic forms, altered states of consciousness, and many more. Axiology: What Is Intrinsically Worthwhile Guba and Lincoln define the basic anatomy of an inquiry paradigm in terms of three fundamental kinds of questions: the ontological question about the nature reality, the epistemological question about the nature of knowing, and the methodological question about how to know and what sorts of injunctions to follow. The question of value is not included as part of the definition of an inquiry paradigm; it is considered to be only one of a range of selected practical issues on which each of their four inquiry paradigms will have a position. We think this is a serious omission, and gives a superficial account of the relation of values to an inquiry paradigm. We take the view that there is a fourth fundamental question that is also necessary to fully define an inquiry paradigm: the axiological question about what is intrinsically worthwhile, what it is about the human condition that is valuable as an end in itself. The first three questions-the ontological, the epistemological, and the methodological-", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm (1).pdf"}, {"id": 237, "text": "t of the relation of values to an inquiry paradigm. We take the view that there is a fourth fundamental question that is also necessary to fully define an inquiry paradigm: the axiological question about what is intrinsically worthwhile, what it is about the human condition that is valuable as an end in itself. The first three questions-the ontological, the epistemological, and the methodological-are all about matters to do with truth. What is really, truly, there? What is the nature of truthful knowledge of it? By what method can the truth be reached? The fourth and axiological question is about values of being, about what human states are to be valued simply by virtue of what they are. This is a necessary complement to balance and make whole the concern with truth exhibited by the first three questions. And the first value question to be raised is about the valuing of knowledge itself. 287 An essential feature of any inquiry paradigm is whether it regards know- ing the truth in propositional form as an end in itself, and as the only end in itself. This was the position of Aristotle for whom intellectual excellence was the highest end of man (but not woman). If knowing propositional truths is the one and only intrinsically worthwhile state of affairs, then ultimately this legitimates all kinds of mayhem on the way to acquiring it. Hence the view of Bacon that nature must be tortured to wrest her secrets from her. Hence the modern propensity to educate the intellect in damaging dissociation from feeling, imagination, and action. Because universities are the home of inquiry paradigms and because they are largely Aristotelian institutions in their commitment to intellectual excellence, we need to know, as a defining feature of it, where each paradigm stands on this fundamental issue. The participatory paradigm answers the axiological question in terms of human flourishing, conceived as an end in itself, where such flourishing is construed as an enabling balance within and between people of hierarchy, cooperation, and autonomy. In our view, social practices and institutions need to enhance human association by an appropriate integration of these three principles: deciding for others, with others, and for oneself (Heron, 1989, 1993). Hierarchy provides appropriate direction by those with greater vision, skill, and experience (Torbert,1991); it is authentic when ", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm (1).pdf"}, {"id": 238, "text": " and between people of hierarchy, cooperation, and autonomy. In our view, social practices and institutions need to enhance human association by an appropriate integration of these three principles: deciding for others, with others, and for oneself (Heron, 1989, 1993). Hierarchy provides appropriate direction by those with greater vision, skill, and experience (Torbert,1991); it is authentic when it seeks the develop- mental emergence of autonomy and cooperation. Collaboration roots the individual within a community of peers, offering basic support and the creative and corrective feedback of other views and possibilities (Randall & Southgate, 1980). Autonomy expresses the creative, self-creating, and self- transfiguring potential of the person (Heron, 1992). The shadow face of authority is authoritarianism; that of collaboration, peer pressure, and conformity; that of autonomy narcissism, willfulness, and isolation. The challenge is to design institutions that manifest valid forms of these principles, and to finds ways in which they can be maintained in self-correcting and creative tension. This kind of flourishing is practical knowing: knowing how to choose and act-hierarchically, cooperatively, autonomously-to enhance personal and social fulfillment and that of the eco-networks of which we are a part. Such human fulfillment is consummated in the very process of choosing and acting. So in the participatory paradigm, practical knowing is an end in itself, and intellectual knowing is of instrumental value in supporting practical excellence. The axiological question can also be put in terms of the ultimate purpose of human inquiry, since any ultimate purpose is an end in itself, a state of affairs that is intrinsically valuable. In the participative worldview, the onto- logical account of reality as subjective-objective, as cocreated with the given cosmos, leads to the axiological question. For what purposes do we cocreate reality? The answer to this is put quite simply by Fals-Borda (1996): to change the world; or, as Skolimowski (1994) pointed out, participation implies engage- 288 ment, which implies responsibility. The participative worldview necessarily leads to an action orientation, not an impulsive action-which, as Bateson (1972) described it, cuts through the circuits of that natural world-but a reflective action, a praxis, grounded in our being in th", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm (1).pdf"}, {"id": 239, "text": "ly by Fals-Borda (1996): to change the world; or, as Skolimowski (1994) pointed out, participation implies engage- 288 ment, which implies responsibility. The participative worldview necessarily leads to an action orientation, not an impulsive action-which, as Bateson (1972) described it, cuts through the circuits of that natural world-but a reflective action, a praxis, grounded in our being in the world. So within the participative worldview the primary purpose of human inquiry is practical: our inquiry is our action in the service of human flour- ishing. Our knowing of the world is consummated as our action in the world, and participatory research is thus essentially transformative. Although some inquiry projects may be primarily information and result in propositional knowing, transformational projects are primary (Heron, 1996). Reason (1993,1994b) suggested that a significant purpose of inquiry in our times is to heal the split that characterizes modern existence, and suggests that such healing practice will have a sacred dimension: To heal means to make whole: we can only understand our world as a whole if we are part of it; as soon as we attempt to stand outside, we divide and separate. In contrast, making whole necessarily implies participation: one characteristic of a participative world view is that the individual person is restored to the circle of community and the human community to the context of the wider natural world. To make whole also means to make holy: another characteristic of a participatory worldview is that meaning and mystery are restored to human experience, so that the world is once again experienced as a sacred place. (Reason, 1994, p. 10) This means expressing living knowledge in practical service to people’s lives (Reason, 1996). This active participation in community, which makes holy, is also a political process (Bachrach & Botwinick, 1992; Bookchin, 1991). It honors the basic right of people to have a say in forms of decision making, in every social context, which affect their flourishing in any way Most impor- tantly, this includes the right to be involved in the knowledge creation processes that affect their lives.

If we compare all this with Guba and Lincoln’s analysis of inquiry aims, we can see that the purposes of inquiry within the participative worldview are closer to those of critical theory, &dquo;the critique and transformation of social, political, economic, ethnic and gender structures that constrain and exploit humankind&dquo; than the constructivist perspective, in which the aim of inquiry is &dquo;understanding and reconstruction.&dquo; However, it is important to acknowl- edge that advocacy and activism are also key concepts of the constructivist view (1995, p. 113). Thus, Guba and Lincoln’s (1989) authenticity criteria, such as catalytic and tactical authenticity, do frame propositional research findings in terms of their impact on transformative actions among the people being studied. However, there are basic epistemological and axiological differences. In terms of the nature of knowledge (Table 2), neither critical theory nor constructivism acknowledge practical knowing, whereas the participatory paradigm regards it as primary. Furthermore, within the participatory para- digm, practical knowing is of central intrinsic value, whereas both construc- 289 V-4 s p0 F ~r sv = ’8 .5 I t0 lIS i8 V @ 290 N W 04 00H s (7% 0B.. 0 g...,Iii id W Ugen 291 tivism and critical theory are concerned only with propositional knowing and its instrumental value in generating social emancipation (see Table 1). They do not acknowledge the intrinsic value of the researchers’ own practical knowing, since this does not play any significant part in their inquiry paradigms. Furthermore, the purpose of inquiry is not only the relief of oppression. As Skolimowski (1994) put it, we need to find again ways in which the human mind can be celebrated, we need to take the courage to imagine and reach for our fullest capabilities. It is argued that humanity is &dquo;nature rendered self- conscious&dquo; (Bookchin, 1991, p. 313), that human beings are a part of the cosmos capable of self-awareness and self-reflection (Swimme, 1984).

We hold that humans consummate such self-awareness as creative agents, whose practical inquiry is a celebration of the flowering of humanity and of the cocreating cosmos, and as part of a sacred science is an expression of the beauty and joy of active existence. IMPLICATIONS OF THE PARTICIPATORY PARADIGM Guba and Lincoln (1994) move on from identifying the basic beliefs of their four paradigms to explore the implications of each. We have both pruned and extended their analysis in Table 2. We have taken out of the table the three issues of inquiry aim, values, and ethics, since these have, in our view, been more appropriately covered in our discussion of the axiological question above. We include a participatory view of all the remaining issues. This makes for a more complete comparison with Guba and Lincoln, but we will not discuss the points in detail. A thorough discussion of cooperative inquiry can be found in Heron (1996), and a review of participatory forms of inquiry can be found in Reason (1994a). CONCLUSION There is an urgent need to revision our view of ourselves as coinhabitants of the planet. As many of us have asserted, with greater or lesser degrees of concern, the current Western worldview has come to the end of its useful life, and, as well as some remarkable achievements in material well-being and human possibility, has left us with a legacy of human alienation and ecological devastation. Deconstructive postmodernism has supplied an invaluable cri- tique of the grand narrative of modernism, but paradoxically can be seen as part of this narrative in its exclusive concern for &dquo;text&dquo; and its denial of the body Constructivism is an incomplete and unsatisfactory response, for rea- sons we have discussed above. The participatory worldview, with its emphasis on the person as an embodied experiencing subject among other subjects, its assertion of the 292 living creative cosmos we coinhabit, and its emphasis on the integration of action with knowing, is more satisfying.

The arguments for a participatory worldview are articulated based on a subjective-objective ontology; an extended epistemology of experiential, presenta- tional, propositional, and practical ways of knowing; a methodology based on cooperative relations between coresearchers; and an axiology that affirms the primary value of practical knowing in the service of human flourishing. INTRODUCTION The notion of a paradigm or worldview as an overarching framework that organizes our whole approach to being in the world has become common- place since Kuhn published The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962. In contrast to the view that a paradigm is, by its very nature, beyond definition and the grasp of the human mind, we believe that the mind, by its very nature, is more extensive than any worldview on which it takes its current cognitive stance. Hence, it is possible and essential to expand our awareness to articu- late any fundamental way in which we frame our world, for differences of epistemology, methodology, and political perspective are usually based on paradigmatic assumptions. Although paradigms can be sketched out in simple cognitive terms, their nature is far richer. As Ogilvy (1986) pointed out, they are about &dquo;models, myths, moods and metaphors&dquo; (p. 48). Guba and Lincoln (1994) made a very useful contribution to articulating and differentiating competing paradigms of inquiry. They identified and Authors’ Note: The authors wish to thank Yvonna Lincoln and an anonymous QI reviewer for their helpful comments.

In this article, we argue that the constructivist paradigm, as they articulate it, is unclear about the relationship between constructed realities and the original givenness of the cosmos, and that a worldview based on participation and participative realities is more helpful and satisfying. We start from and extend the Guba and Lincoln framework to articulate a participatory paradigm. We argue that a fundamental quality of the participative worldview, which it shares with Guba and Lincoln’s constructivism, is that it is self-reflexive. The participative mind-which Heron (1996) also termed the postconceptual mind-articulates reality within a paradigm, articulates the paradigm itself, and can in principle reach out to the wider context of that paradigm to reframe it. A basic problem of positivist mind is that it cannot acknowledge the framing paradigm it has created. It confuses the given cosmos with the worldview it has generated to shape the given. It cannot see that the ground, on which it stands to frame its world, is its own creation. It thus tends toward immodesty, intolerance, and the oppression of scientism. The most extreme rejection of positivism is that form of postmortem poststructuralism, derived from the deconstruction of Derrida (1976, 1981), which holds that there are no transcendental grounds for truth outside the text. Its basic problem is that it dismisses any ground as valid simply because there is another ground or context beyond it. It confuses relative truth with nihilistic skepticism; it thinks that because no ground is final, no ground has any claim to truth. It thus tends toward a restless anarchy of raw, purposeless power. The case for a participative worldview has underpinned our work on cooperative inquiry and other participative forms of action research over the past 20 years and more. We have articulated this perspective as an epistemo- logical and political principle more recently (Heron, 1996; Reason & Heron, 1995). In parallel with this, other writers have developed arguments that include a participative perspective (Berman, 1981; Tarnas, 1991; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1993), whereas Skolimowski (1994) developed the per- spective he terms the participatory mind.

A particularly elegant elucidation of participatory perception and language and its implications for ecological thinking can be found in Abram (1996). Although our articulation in this article of a participatory worldview is necessarily expressed in propositional language, we wish to at least point toward the sense of resolution and meaning, of joy and beauty, the image of participation brings to us personally The image shows us how to move away from the mechanical abstraction of the Cartesian worldview, and from the relativism that appears first as its counterpoint, to an experience of participa- tory reality. The participatory worldview allows us as human persons to know that we are part of the whole rather than separated as mind over and against matter, or placed here in the relatively separate creation of a transcen- dent god. It allows us to join with fellow humans in collaborative forms of 276 inquiry. It places us back in relation with the living world-and we note that to be in relation means that we live with the rest of creation as relatives, with all the rights and obligations that implies (Storm, 1972, 1994). Our warrant, therefore, for the choice and assertion of a participatory worldview is fundamentally experiential. Our work with cooperative inquiry, in mindfulness practices and ceremony, and our attempts at aware everyday living all convince us that experiential encounter with the presence of the world is the ground of our being and knowing. This encounter is prior to language and art-although it can be symbolized in language and art. Our experience is that our meeting with the elemental properties of the living world, or the I-thou encounter with a living tree or person, cannot be confused with our symbolic constructs. In terms we use later in the article, while propositional and presentational knowledge are grounded on and symbolize experiential knowledge, experiential knowledge cannot be reduced to either of them.

In terms we use later in the article, while propositional and presentational knowledge are grounded on and symbolize experiential knowledge, experiential knowledge cannot be reduced to either of them. This, we argue, is not a dissociated metaphysical statement; rather, it is an expression of a radical empiricism that can be tested through experi- ential inquiry, and we invite others, both skeptical and sympathetic, to inquire with us as to the validity of our perspective. This form of radical empiricism is not to be confused with behaviorism, which has never been empirical enough, because it preconceives and delimits experience in terms of its positivist paradigm. On the contrary, our empiricism is the radical sort long since commended by phenomenologists; a pristine acquaintance with phenomena unadulterated by preconceptions (Spiegel- berg, 1960). It is unrestricted experience of the &dquo;lived-through world,&dquo; which Merleau-Ponty insisted is misrepresented and distorted by the limiting can- ons of the &dquo;objective thought&dquo; of positivist science and &dquo;dogmatic common sense&dquo; (Merleau-Ponty, 1962; Hammond, Howarth, & Keat, 1991). We think it important to reclaim the notion of empiricism from positivist abuse and restore it to more fruitful use in terms of this kind of liberated experience (Heron, 1996). The empirical is based on experience, and it ceases to be empirical when experience is constrained by a restricting definition. THE NATURE OF INQUIRY PARADIGMS Guba and Lincoln argued that inquiry paradigms may be viewed as sets of basic beliefs about the nature of reality and how it may be known; and that these beliefs are thrown into relief by three fundamental and interrelated questions. There is the ontological question, &dquo;What is the form and nature of reality and, therefore, what is there than can be known about it?&dquo;; the epistemological question, &dquo;What is the relationship between the knower or would-be knower and what can be known&dquo;; and the methodological ques- tion, &dquo;How can the inquirer ... go about finding out whatever he or she believes can be known about?&dquo; 277 Guba and Lincoln began by identifying the responses proponents of the four different paradigms would make to the three questions identified above.

These response are given in Figure 1, the first five columns of which are taken directly from Guba and Lincoln. The final Participatory column is our addi- tion. We also added a fourth row, Axiology, which is omitted from the Guba and Lincoln account, and which we think is an essential defining charac- teristic of an inquiry paradigm, alongside ontology, epistemology, and meth- odology. The axiological question asks what is intrinsically valuable in human life, in particular what sort of knowledge, if any, is intrinsically valuable. This is discussed in a later section. We will not go into the details of Guba and Lincoln’s analysis; rather, we will concentrate on identifying our problems with the constructivist world- view that they espouse and articulating a participative worldview. We understand from Guba and Lincoln (1989) that the real is a mental construct of individuals, and such constructs &dquo;do not exist outside of the persons who create and hold them&dquo; (p. 143). Thus, there can be many such constructed realities; and they may be conflicting and incompatible. Con- structions are not more or less &dquo;true&dquo;; rather, they are more or less sophisti- cated and informed. As Heron (1996) argued: There is an immediate difficulty with the idea that reality is a construction within an individual mind. It raises the problem of solipsism, which is an ironic problemfor a science of the Other. For if reality is nothing but an internal mental construct, no warrant can be given for supposing that the other people being studied actually exist, let alone for supposing that the researcher’s view of them ade- quately represents their own view of their situation. However, Guba and Lincoln are ambiguous in their account of constructivism. They also say that the mental constructions are related to &dquo;tangible entities&dquo;, which would thus appear to have some reality independent of the constructions (Schwandt, 1994: 134).

So their explicit idealist stance seems to rest on an implicit realism, and leaves the paradigm in a state of wobble. (p. 10) Constructivist views tend to be deficient in any acknowledgment of expe- riential knowing; that is, knowing by acquaintance, by meeting, and by felt participation in the presence of what is there. Von Glasersfeld thought we cannot in any way know a &dquo;real&dquo; world, and cannot even imagine it, because we cannot conceive of anything existing without the notions of space and time, which are our own constructs (von Glasersfeld, 1991, p. 17). This is the Kantian view that space and time are a priori forms that the mind imposes on reality, nothing to do with reality itself. But Kant only laid hold of the mind as making the world through conceptual constructs. He did not grasp that the mind is also meeting given reality through participating in its being, and that the mind makes its world by meeting the given. Thus, we take the view that the mind’s conceptual articulation of the world is grounded in its experiential participation in what is present, in what there is. This statement is open to misunderstanding without further elaboration. 278 The constructivist and participatory paradigms are in agreement that it is not possible in linguistic, conceptual terms to give any final or absolute account of what there is. Propositional knowing can only give mediated-subjective and intersubjective-relativistic accounts. The participatory paradigm goes fur- ther and asserts that we cannot have any final or absolute experiential knowing of what there is; in the relation of knowing by acquaintance, the experiential knower shapes perceptually what is there. And this is still so when the perceiving mind is relatively free of conceptual labels imposed on its imaging of reality. However, the point about experiential knowing is that the very process of perceiving is also a meeting, a transaction, with what there is.

And this is still so when the perceiving mind is relatively free of conceptual labels imposed on its imaging of reality. However, the point about experiential knowing is that the very process of perceiving is also a meeting, a transaction, with what there is. When I hold your hand, my tactual imaging both subjectively shapes you and objectively meets you. To encounter being or a being is both to image it in my way and to know that it is there. To experience anything is to participate in it, and to participate is both to mold and to encounter; hence, experiential reality is always subjective-objective. There is an analog here with Rahner’s modem theology of revelation, in which he spoke paradoxically of &dquo;mediated-immediacy&dquo;: we experience divine presence always in mediated form (Dulles, 1992). Experiential knowing is subjective-objective and so relative to the knower. It is also relative to the given cosmos, but with greater immediacy, lesser mediation, than propositional knowing. Experiential knowing is thus a ground, albeit not an absolute ground, for the symbolic frameworks of conceptual, propositional knowing. Constructivists Guba and Lincoln ac- knowledge, as the citation above states, that conceptual constructs are related to &dquo;tangible entities&dquo; and thus appear to accept tangible or experiential knowing. They do not, however, articulate the nature of experiential knowing and do not regard it as providing any kind of warrant for the valid use of conceptual constructs; hence our statement earlier that constructivist views tend to be deficient in any acknowledgment of it. Thus, Gergen (1986) reduced reality to an intersubjective social construc- tion generated by collective language use and other social practices. Such social constructions have no independently identifiable real-world referents (p. 143). Both von Glasersfeld and Gergen are so busy rejecting the idea of an independent, objective world as the absolute ground of conceptual knowl- edge claims that they overlook the idea of an experiential subjective-objective world as the relative ground of such claims.

THE PARTICIPATORY WORLDVIEW It is this idea of subjective-objective reality that launches our response to Guba and Lincoln’s three questions from the perspective of the participative worldview. 279 Ontology: Subjective-Objective There is a given cosmos, a primordial reality, in which the mind actively participates. Mind and the given cosmos are engaged in a cocreative dance, so that what emerges as reality is the fruit of an interaction of the given cosmos and the way mind engages with it. Mind actively participates in the cosmos, and it is through this active participation that we meet what is Other: &dquo;Worlds and people are what we meet, but the meeting is shaped by our own terms of reference&dquo; (Heron, 1996, p. 11). The skeptic may ask how we can know we meet anything or anyone if the meeting is always given our own shape. The answer is that when we open ourselves to meeting the given we are arrested by the presence of Other; or to put it another way, the Other declares itself to us so that we resonate with its presence in the world. Abram (1996) made a similar point and showed that it not only includes Husserl’s point that the field of appearances is &dquo;seen to be inhabited by multiple subjectivities ... by other experiencing subjects as well as by oneself’ (p. 37; emphasis in original); it also embraces the view of Merleau-Ponty (1962), who took Husserl’s argument a stage further, showing how perception itself is participatory so that in so far as my hand knows hardness and softness, and my gaze knows the moon’s light, It is as a certain way of linking up with the phenomena and communicating with it. Hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, moonlight and sunlight, present themselves in our recollection not pre-emi- nently as sensory contents but as certain kinds of symbioses, certain ways the outside has of invading us and certain ways we have of meeting the invasion. (p. 317) According to Abram (1996), this means that there is &dquo;underneath our literate abstractions, a deeply participatory relation to things and to the earth, a felt reciprocity&dquo; (p. 124).

This encounter is transactional, interactive; to touch, see, or hear some- thing or someone does not tell us either about our self all on its own or about a being out there all on its own. It tells us about a being in a state of interrelation and copresence with us. Our subjectivity feels the participation of what is there and is illuminated by it. Knowing a world is in this felt relation at the interactive interface between a subject and what is encountered. In the relation of meeting, my subjectivity becomes a perspectival window filled with a world that also transcends it. This ontology is thus subjective-objective: It is subjective because it is only known through the form the mind gives it; and it is objective because the mind interpenetrates the given cosmos which it shapes. (Heron, 1996, p. 11) Or, as Skolimowski (1994) put it, 280 Things become what our consciousness makes of them through the active participation of our mind. (pp. 27-28) The cosmos or the universe is a primordial ontological datum, while the &dquo;world&dquo; is an epistemological construct, a form of our understanding. (p. 100) Bateson made the point that between the extremes of solipsism, in which &dquo;I make it all up,&dquo; and a purely external reality in which I cease to exist, there is a region where you are partly blown by the winds of reality and partly an artist creating a composite out of inner and outer events. (cited in Brockman, 1977, p. 245) From all this it follows that what can be known about the given cosmos is that it is always known as a subjectively articulated world, whose objectivity is relative to how it is shaped by the knower. But this is not all; its objectivity is also relative to how it is intersubjectively shaped. For there is the important if obvious point that knowers can only be knowers when known by other knowers. Knowing presupposes mutual participative awareness. It presup- poses participation, through meeting and dialogue, in a culture of shared art and shared language, shared values, norms, and beliefs.

It presup- poses participation, through meeting and dialogue, in a culture of shared art and shared language, shared values, norms, and beliefs. And, deeper still, agreement about the rules of language, about how to use it, presupposes a tacit mutual experiential knowing and understanding between people that is the primary ground of all explicit forms of knowing. So any subjective- objective reality articulated by any one person is done so within an intersub- jective field, a context of both linguistic-cultural and experiential shared meanings. Epistemology: Critical Subjectivity and Four Ways of Knowing A participative worldview, with its notion of reality as subjective-objective, involves an extended epistemology. A knower participates in the known, articulates a world, in at least four interdependent ways: experiential, presen- tational, propositional, and practical. These four forms of knowing constitute the manifold of our subjectivity, within which, it seems, we have enormous latitude both in acknowledging its components and in using them in associa- tion with, or dissociation from, each other. This epistemology presents us as knowers with an interesting developmental challenge. We call this challenge critical subjectivity. It involves an awareness of the four ways of knowing, of how they are currently interacting, and of ways of changing the relations between them so that they articulate a reality that is unclouded by a restrictive and ill-disciplined subjectivity. Experiential knowing means direct encounter, face-to-face meeting: feel- ing and imaging the presence of some energy, entity, person, place, process, 281 or thing. It is knowing through participative, empathic resonance with a being, so that as knower I feel both attuned with it and distinct from it. It is also the creative shaping of a world through the transaction of imaging it, perceptually and in other ways. Experiential knowing thus articulates reality through inner resonance with what there is and through perceptually enact- ing (Varela et al., 1993) its forms of appearing.

It is also the creative shaping of a world through the transaction of imaging it, perceptually and in other ways. Experiential knowing thus articulates reality through inner resonance with what there is and through perceptually enact- ing (Varela et al., 1993) its forms of appearing. Presentational knowing emerges from and is grounded in experiential knowing. It is evident in an intuitive grasp of the significance of our resonance with and imaging of our world as this grasp is symbolized in graphic, plastic, musical, vocal, and verbal art forms. It clothes our experiential knowing of the world in the metaphors of aesthetic creation, in expressive spatiotemporal forms of imagery. These forms symbolize both our felt attunement with the world and the primary meaning embedded in our enactment of its appearing. Propositional knowing is knowing in conceptual terms that something is the case; knowledge by description of some energy, entity person, place, process, or thing. It is expressed in statements and theories that come with the mastery of concepts and classes that language bestows. Propositions themselves are carried by presentational forms-the sounds or visual shapes of the spoken or written word-and are ultimately grounded in our experi- ential articulation of a world. Practical knowing is knowing how to do something, demonstrated in a skill or competence. We would argue that practical knowledge is in an important sense primary (Heron, 1996). It presupposes a conceptual grasp of principles and standards of practice, presentational elegance, and experiential grounding in the situation within which the action occurs. It fulfills the three prior forms of knowing, brings them to fruition in purposive deeds, and consummates them with its autonomous celebration of excellent accomplishment. As Macmurray (1957) pointed out, although you can divorce thought from action, you cannot divorce action in the world from thought. And we believe that what we learn about our world will be richer and deeper if this descrip- tive knowledge is incidental to a primary intention to develop practical skills to change the world. This is the action paradox: We learn more profoundly about our worlds when we are more interested in enhancing them with excellence of action than in learning about them.

This is the action paradox: We learn more profoundly about our worlds when we are more interested in enhancing them with excellence of action than in learning about them. (Heron, 1996, p. 114) Torbert (1991, p. 221) underlined the preeminence of practical knowing with his view that what we need is an action inquiry useful to the actor and the point of action rather than a reflective science about action. His account of action inquiry is that a person is conscious in the midst of action, seeing and correcting, on-line, incongruities among the goal of the action and wider purposes within which it is nested, the strategic means, the immediate 282 Figure 1 behavior, and outcomes in the world. This, he holds, is a holistic and inclusive inquiry paradigm. It is equally important that action not only consummates the prior forms of knowing but is grounded in them. It is in this congruence of the four aspects of the extended epistemology that lie claims to validity (this relationship is shown in Figure 1). Critical subjectivity means that we attend both to the grounding relations between the forms of knowing and to their consummating relations. Thus, it is a close relative of Torbert’s (1991) &dquo;consciousness in the midst of action&dquo; (p. 221). Critical subjectivity is a state of consciousness different from either the naive subjectivity of &dquo;primary process&dquo; awareness or the attempted objectivity of egoic &dquo;secondary process&dquo; awareness. It means that we do not suppress our primary subjective experience but accept that it is our experien- tial articulation of being in a world, and as such is the ground of all our knowing. At the same time, we accept that, naively exercised, it is open to all the distortions of those defensive processes by which people collude to limit their understanding. So we attend to it with a critical consciousness, seeking to bring it into aware relation with the other three ways of knowing so that they clarify and refine and elevate it at the same time as being more adequately grounded in it.

In addition, because we accept that our knowing is from a perspective and that we are aware of that perspective-of its authentic value and of its restricting bias-we articulate this awareness in our communications. Critical subjectivity involves a self-reflexive attention to the ground on which one is standing. This is echoed in what Torbert (1987) called &dquo;a refraining mind&dquo; that &dquo;continually overcomes itself, divesting itself of its own presuppositions&dquo; 283 (p. 211). It is related to what Bateson (1972) described as Learning III, in which the mind can choose its premises of understanding and action, can detach itself from all frameworks to peer into and reflect on their presuppositions. It is Kegan’s (1994) transparadigmatic fourth-order consciousness and Gebser’s (1985) integral-aperspectival mind which grasps that no perspective is final, is transparent to the context of its own operation, is open to the context of that context, and so on. It also relates to those moderate postmortem poststructu- ralists who do not deny truth and meaning as such, but hold that all truth and meaning are relative to a context, and that context is boundless, infinitely extendable (Culler, 1982). The constructivism of Guba and Lincoln (1989) holds that standards for determining what is relatively true reside in community consensus. What the participatory paradigm adds to this is the view that any conceptual context is itself set within a wider and deeper experiential context. Propositional truth is not only relative to the linguistic and conceptual context of the community in which it is uttered. It is also relative to the substrate of shared experiential primary meaning, which is the contextual ground for the use of language and conceptual exchange within the community (Heron, 1996).

Methodology: Collaborative Forms of Action Inquiry Inquiry methodology within a participative worldview needs to be one that draws on this extended epistemology in such a way that critical subjec- tivity is enhanced by critical intersubjectivity; hence, a collaborative form of inquiry, in which all involved engage together in democratic dialogue as coresearchers and as cosubjects (Heron, 1996; Reason & Heron, 1995). In our articulation of this, which we call cooperative inquiry, people collaborate to define the questions they wish to explore and the methodology for that exploration (propositional knowing). Together or separately they apply this methodology in the world of their practice (practical knowing), which leads to new forms of encounter with their world (experiential knowing); and they find ways to represent this experience in significant patterns (presentational knowing), which feeds into a revised propositional understanding of the originating questions. Thus, coresearchers engage together in cycling several times through the four forms of knowing to enrich their congruence; that is, to refine the way they elevate and consummate each other, and to deepen the complementary way they are grounded in each other. 284 Research cycling is itself a fundamental discipline that leads toward critical subjectivity and a primary way of enhancing the validity of inquirers’ claims to articulate a subjective-objective reality. There is also a range of further procedures that develop this effect. These include managing divergence and convergence within and between cycles, balancing reflection and action, challenging uncritical subjectivity and intersubjectivity, managing unaware projections and displaced anxiety, attending to the dynamic interplay of chaos and order, and securing authentic collaboration (for a full discussion of these, together with a set of radical skills of being and doing required during the action phases of the inquiry, see Heron, ", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm.pdf"}, {"id": 260, "text": "ween cycles, balancing reflection and action, challenging uncritical subjectivity and intersubjectivity, managing unaware projections and displaced anxiety, attending to the dynamic interplay of chaos and order, and securing authentic collaboration (for a full discussion of these, together with a set of radical skills of being and doing required during the action phases of the inquiry, see Heron, 1996). Although cooperative inquiry has formed the basis of our theorizing and practice, we see it as closely related to other forms of participative inquiry such as action science (Argyris, Putnam, & Smith, 1985; Argyris & Schon, 1974; Schon, 1983), action inquiry (Torbert, 1991), participatory action research (Fals-Borda & Rahman, 1991), some forms of feminist inquiry (Mies, 1993; Olesen, 1994), emancipatory action research (Carr & Kemmis, 1986), appre- ciative inquiry (Cooperrider and Srivastva, 1987), fourth-generation evalu- ation (Guba & Lincoln, 1989), intervention research (Fryer & Feather, 1994), action research as democratic dialogue (Toulmin & Gustavsen) 1996), and others. Fals-Borda and Rahman (1991) reported that some 35 varieties of participative action inquiry have been identified worldwide. Cooperative inquiry rests on two participatory principles: epistemic par- ticipation and political participation. The first means that any propositional knowledge that is the outcome of the research is grounded by the researchers in their own experiential knowledge. The second means that research subjects have a basic human right to participate fully in designing the research that intends to gather knowledge about them. It follows from the first principle that the researchers are also the subjects; and from the second principle that the subjects are also the researchers. The coresearchers are also the cosubjects. The research is done by people with each other, not by researchers on other people or about them. In mainline qualitative research, done within the aegis of constructivism, neither of these two principles applies. Such research, using multiple meth- odologies, is about other people studied in their own social setting and understood in terms of the meanings those people themselves bring to their situation (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994, p. 2).

The researchers are not also subjects. They ground their propositional findings not on their own experiential knowing but on that of other people, the researched subjects, as reflected in the subjects’ dialogue with the researchers. The researchers’ own experiential knowing as occasional participant observers within the subjects’ culture tend to be secondary and subordinate. Moreover, this kind of analysis is not one constructivist researchers would use, since constructivism does not have any identified epistemological role in its inquiry paradigm for experiential know- ing. The principle of epistemic participation is not acknowledged. 285 Nor does the principle of political participation apply. Mainline qualitative research has not grasped the right of informants to participate in formulating the research design, so that they can manifest fully their values in the way knowledge about them is generated. The great majority of its projects are still unilaterally shaped by the researchers, however emergent that shape may be, however much informed consent is sought, and however much the re- searchers may be concerned to check their findings with informants’ views. Recent texts for graduate students on qualitative research design, which claim constructivist lineage, make no provision of any kind for the inclusion of subjects or informants in design decisions; nor is the issue of such participa- tion anywhere discussed (Creswell, 1994; Erlandson, Harris, Skipper, & Allen, 1993; Marshall & Rossman, 1995). It is important, however, to acknowledge that within the whole field of qualitative research, there are methodologies that involve subjects in design issues, and several of these have been mentioned above. Denzin and Lincoln (1994) have drawn our attention to the crisis of legitimation in qualitative research, which asks by what right researchers claim to speak for the people they have studied.

Denzin and Lincoln (1994) have drawn our attention to the crisis of legitimation in qualitative research, which asks by what right researchers claim to speak for the people they have studied. Lincoln (1997) took this question further, asking &dquo;How do we go about sharing authority for a text with the people who have the authority to tell us about their lives and to make those lives make sense to us?&dquo; Once we acknowledge the need to collaborate, how do we negotiate how the findings will be used? If I’m going to collaborate with people and I’m really going to live up to that commitment, I can’t just write a report all by myself. If we generate a report together, we decide together how it’s going to be used. (Lincoln, 1997, p. 9) It is also important, in discussing this overlap between cooperative inquiry and other forms of participative research, to distinguish between the democ- ratization of content, which involves all informants in decisions about what the research is seeking to find out and achieve; and the democratization of method, which involves participants in decisions about what operational methods are being used, including those being used to democratize the content. The overlap is usually restricted to democratization of research content. It is rare to find any full-blown commitment to collaboration about research method, although Guba and Lincoln strongly commend it (see below). In practice, it may be reduced to no more than seeking fully informed consent of all informants to the researcher’s preexistent or emerging opera- tional plan, and to modifying the plan to obtain such consent. Qualitative research about people is a halfway house between exclusive, controlling, quantitative, positivist research on people and fully participatory, cooperative research with people. The more it involves subjects in the full range of issues involved in research decision making, not only about content issues but also about operational methods, and the more fully researchers participate in the cultures they are studying, the more it shifts in the direction 286 of cooperative inquiry.

Guba and Lincoln (1989), in their account of fourth- generation evaluation, pointed the way toward this shift, so far as political participation is concerned: Fourth generation evaluation mandates that the evaluator move from the role of controller to that of collaborator. The evaluator must share control, however much that appears to threaten the &dquo;technical adequacy&dquo; of the evaluation. That is, the evaluator must solicit and honour stakeholder inputs not only about the substance of constructions but also with respect to the methodology of the evalu- ation itself. (p. 260) Finally, qualitative research is a social science about other people in their own social setting, whereas cooperative inquiry is a wide-ranging science about any aspect of the human condition that a group of coresearchers choose to explore through the instrumentality of their own experience. It certainly includes important social topics, such as revisioning social roles, professional practice, and organizational life. It also includes innumerable others, such as art as a mode of knowledge, intentional self-healing, participative knowledge of organic and inorganic forms, altered states of consciousness, and many more. Axiology: What Is Intrinsically Worthwhile Guba and Lincoln define the basic anatomy of an inquiry paradigm in terms of three fundamental kinds of questions: the ontological question about the nature reality, the epistemological question about the nature of knowing, and the methodological question about how to know and what sorts of injunctions to follow. The question of value is not included as part of the definition of an inquiry paradigm; it is considered to be only one of a range of selected practical issues on which each of their four inquiry paradigms will have a position. We think this is a serious omission, and gives a superficial account of the relation of values to an inquiry paradigm. We take the view that there is a fourth fundamental question that is also necessary to fully define an inquiry paradigm: the axiological question about what is intrinsically worthwhile, what it is about the human condition that is valuable as an end in itself. The first three questions-the ontological, the epistemological, and the methodological-", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm.pdf"}, {"id": 264, "text": "t of the relation of values to an inquiry paradigm. We take the view that there is a fourth fundamental question that is also necessary to fully define an inquiry paradigm: the axiological question about what is intrinsically worthwhile, what it is about the human condition that is valuable as an end in itself. The first three questions-the ontological, the epistemological, and the methodological-are all about matters to do with truth. What is really, truly, there? What is the nature of truthful knowledge of it? By what method can the truth be reached? The fourth and axiological question is about values of being, about what human states are to be valued simply by virtue of what they are. This is a necessary complement to balance and make whole the concern with truth exhibited by the first three questions. And the first value question to be raised is about the valuing of knowledge itself. 287 An essential feature of any inquiry paradigm is whether it regards know- ing the truth in propositional form as an end in itself, and as the only end in itself. This was the position of Aristotle for whom intellectual excellence was the highest end of man (but not woman). If knowing propositional truths is the one and only intrinsically worthwhile state of affairs, then ultimately this legitimates all kinds of mayhem on the way to acquiring it. Hence the view of Bacon that nature must be tortured to wrest her secrets from her. Hence the modern propensity to educate the intellect in damaging dissociation from feeling, imagination, and action. Because universities are the home of inquiry paradigms and because they are largely Aristotelian institutions in their commitment to intellectual excellence, we need to know, as a defining feature of it, where each paradigm stands on this fundamental issue. The participatory paradigm answers the axiological question in terms of human flourishing, conceived as an end in itself, where such flourishing is construed as an enabling balance within and between people of hierarchy, cooperation, and autonomy. In our view, social practices and institutions need to enhance human association by an appropriate integration of these three principles: deciding for others, with others, and for oneself (Heron, 1989, 1993). Hierarchy provides appropriate direction by those with greater vision, skill, and experience (Torbert,1991); it is authentic when ", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm.pdf"}, {"id": 265, "text": " and between people of hierarchy, cooperation, and autonomy. In our view, social practices and institutions need to enhance human association by an appropriate integration of these three principles: deciding for others, with others, and for oneself (Heron, 1989, 1993). Hierarchy provides appropriate direction by those with greater vision, skill, and experience (Torbert,1991); it is authentic when it seeks the develop- mental emergence of autonomy and cooperation. Collaboration roots the individual within a community of peers, offering basic support and the creative and corrective feedback of other views and possibilities (Randall & Southgate, 1980). Autonomy expresses the creative, self-creating, and self- transfiguring potential of the person (Heron, 1992). The shadow face of authority is authoritarianism; that of collaboration, peer pressure, and conformity; that of autonomy narcissism, willfulness, and isolation. The challenge is to design institutions that manifest valid forms of these principles, and to finds ways in which they can be maintained in self-correcting and creative tension. This kind of flourishing is practical knowing: knowing how to choose and act-hierarchically, cooperatively, autonomously-to enhance personal and social fulfillment and that of the eco-networks of which we are a part. Such human fulfillment is consummated in the very process of choosing and acting. So in the participatory paradigm, practical knowing is an end in itself, and intellectual knowing is of instrumental value in supporting practical excellence. The axiological question can also be put in terms of the ultimate purpose of human inquiry, since any ultimate purpose is an end in itself, a state of affairs that is intrinsically valuable. In the participative worldview, the onto- logical account of reality as subjective-objective, as cocreated with the given cosmos, leads to the axiological question. For what purposes do we cocreate reality? The answer to this is put quite simply by Fals-Borda (1996): to change the world; or, as Skolimowski (1994) pointed out, participation implies engage- 288 ment, which implies responsibility. The participative worldview necessarily leads to an action orientation, not an impulsive action-which, as Bateson (1972) described it, cuts through the circuits of that natural world-but a reflective action, a praxis, grounded in our being in th", "source": "heron-reason-1997-a-participatory-inquiry-paradigm.pdf"}, {"id": 266, "text": "ly by Fals-Borda (1996): to change the world; or, as Skolimowski (1994) pointed out, participation implies engage- 288 ment, which implies responsibility. The participative worldview necessarily leads to an action orientation, not an impulsive action-which, as Bateson (1972) described it, cuts through the circuits of that natural world-but a reflective action, a praxis, grounded in our being in the world. So within the participative worldview the primary purpose of human inquiry is practical: our inquiry is our action in the service of human flour- ishing. Our knowing of the world is consummated as our action in the world, and participatory research is thus essentially transformative. Although some inquiry projects may be primarily information and result in propositional knowing, transformational projects are primary (Heron, 1996). Reason (1993,1994b) suggested that a significant purpose of inquiry in our times is to heal the split that characterizes modern existence, and suggests that such healing practice will have a sacred dimension: To heal means to make whole: we can only understand our world as a whole if we are part of it; as soon as we attempt to stand outside, we divide and separate. In contrast, making whole necessarily implies participation: one characteristic of a participative world view is that the individual person is restored to the circle of community and the human community to the context of the wider natural world. To make whole also means to make holy: another characteristic of a participatory worldview is that meaning and mystery are restored to human experience, so that the world is once again experienced as a sacred place. (Reason, 1994, p. 10) This means expressing living knowledge in practical service to people’s lives (Reason, 1996). This active participation in community, which makes holy, is also a political process (Bachrach & Botwinick, 1992; Bookchin, 1991). It honors the basic right of people to have a say in forms of decision making, in every social context, which affect their flourishing in any way Most impor- tantly, this includes the right to be involved in the knowledge creation processes that affect their lives.

If we compare all this with Guba and Lincoln’s analysis of inquiry aims, we can see that the purposes of inquiry within the participative worldview are closer to those of critical theory, &dquo;the critique and transformation of social, political, economic, ethnic and gender structures that constrain and exploit humankind&dquo; than the constructivist perspective, in which the aim of inquiry is &dquo;understanding and reconstruction.&dquo; However, it is important to acknowl- edge that advocacy and activism are also key concepts of the constructivist view (1995, p. 113). Thus, Guba and Lincoln’s (1989) authenticity criteria, such as catalytic and tactical authenticity, do frame propositional research findings in terms of their impact on transformative actions among the people being studied. However, there are basic epistemological and axiological differences. In terms of the nature of knowledge (Table 2), neither critical theory nor constructivism acknowledge practical knowing, whereas the participatory paradigm regards it as primary. Furthermore, within the participatory para- digm, practical knowing is of central intrinsic value, whereas both construc- 289 V-4 s p0 F ~r sv = ’8 .5 I t0 lIS i8 V @ 290 N W 04 00H s (7% 0B.. 0 g...,Iii id W Ugen 291 tivism and critical theory are concerned only with propositional knowing and its instrumental value in generating social emancipation (see Table 1). They do not acknowledge the intrinsic value of the researchers’ own practical knowing, since this does not play any significant part in their inquiry paradigms. Furthermore, the purpose of inquiry is not only the relief of oppression. As Skolimowski (1994) put it, we need to find again ways in which the human mind can be celebrated, we need to take the courage to imagine and reach for our fullest capabilities. It is argued that humanity is &dquo;nature rendered self- conscious&dquo; (Bookchin, 1991, p. 313), that human beings are a part of the cosmos capable of self-awareness and self-reflection (Swimme, 1984).

It is argued that humanity is &dquo;nature rendered self- conscious&dquo; (Bookchin, 1991, p. 313), that human beings are a part of the cosmos capable of self-awareness and self-reflection (Swimme, 1984). We hold that humans consummate such self-awareness as creative agents, whose practical inquiry is a celebration of the flowering of humanity and of the cocreating cosmos, and as part of a sacred science is an expression of the beauty and joy of active existence. IMPLICATIONS OF THE PARTICIPATORY PARADIGM Guba and Lincoln (1994) move on from identifying the basic beliefs of their four paradigms to explore the implications of each. We have both pruned and extended their analysis in Table 2. We have taken out of the table the three issues of inquiry aim, values, and ethics, since these have, in our view, been more appropriately covered in our discussion of the axiological question above. We include a participatory view of all the remaining issues. This makes for a more complete comparison with Guba and Lincoln, but we will not discuss the points in detail. A thorough discussion of cooperative inquiry can be found in Heron (1996), and a review of participatory forms of inquiry can be found in Reason (1994a). CONCLUSION There is an urgent need to revision our view of ourselves as coinhabitants of the planet. As many of us have asserted, with greater or lesser degrees of concern, the current Western worldview has come to the end of its useful life, and, as well as some remarkable achievements in material well-being and human possibility, has left us with a legacy of human alienation and ecological devastation. Deconstructive postmodernism has supplied an invaluable cri- tique of the grand narrative of modernism, but paradoxically can be seen as part of this narrative in its exclusive concern for &dquo;text&dquo; and its denial of the body Constructivism is an incomplete and unsatisfactory response, for rea- sons we have discussed above. The participatory worldview, with its emphasis on the person as an embodied experiencing subject among other subjects, its assertion of the 292 living creative cosmos we coinhabit, and its emphasis on the integration of action with knowing, is more satisfying.

Our purpose is to orient students, faculty and beginning researchers to the newer paradigms that enable researchers to undertake unique ly powerful and insightful inquiries that contribute to transforming the landscape of education. Keywords: postgraduate research, new paradigms, teacher education, transformation, metaphor Introduction For decades during the late 20 th Century, ‘paradigm wars’ raged amongst supporters arguing fiercely for the superiority of their chosen paradigm. Over time, this gave way to a ‘paradigm dialogue’ in which supporters came to accept their differences and realised that every research paradigm is of equal importance. No research paradigm is superior, but each has a specific purpose in providing a distinct means of producing unique knowledge .

No research paradigm is superior, but each has a specific purpose in providing a distinct means of producing unique knowledge . Thanks to the newer paradigms, educational researchers (including teacher -researchers) are providing empirical and theoretical evidence of ways in which traditional curriculum and assessment policies unduly constrain teaching and learning, and research practices in schools, colleges and universities. And, importantly, these researchers are being empowered to envisage new policies and practices that better meet the emerging educational needs of their rapidly globalising societies. The term paradigm needs clarification. Willis (2007) explains that: “ A paradigm is thus a comprehensive belief s ystem, world view, or framework that guides researc h and practice in a 2 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D. (2013).

From a philosophical perspective , a paradigm comprises a view of the nature of reality (i.e., ontology) - whether it is external or internal to the knower; a related view of the type of knowledge that can be generated and standards for justifying it (i.e., epistemology); and a disciplined approach to generating that knowledge (i.e., methodology). For educational researchers, there are several major parad igms that govern their inquiries into the policies and practices of education. Each paradigm carries related theories of teaching and learning (or pedagogy), curriculum and assessment, professional development, etc. TRADITIONAL PARADIGMS We will not spend much time on these tried and trusted paradigms, as there is a plethora of social science research methods textbooks that serve this purpose. The outlines provided here serve simply as a basis of comparison with the newer paradigms addressed later in the paper.

The outlines provided here serve simply as a basis of comparison with the newer paradigms addressed later in the paper. Positivist Paradigm We start with positivism, a research paradigm that is very well known and well established in universities worldwide . This ‘scientific’ research paradigm strives to investigate, confirm and predict law-like patterns of behavi our, and i s common ly used in graduate research to test theories or hypotheses. This is particularly useful in natural science, physical science and, to some extent, in the social sciences, especially where very large sample sizes are involved . Generally it s focus is on the objectivity of the research process ( Creswell, 2008).The positivist paradigm mostly involves quantitative methodology , utilizing experimental methods involving experimental (or treatment) and control groups and administration of pre- and post-tests to measure gain scores . Here, the researcher is ext ernal to the research site and is the controller of the research process. An example of research in this paradigm is the second author’s undergraduate biology research at Central Mindanao Un iversity, Philippines, entitled “Anti-diarrheal activity of M. Pudica leaf extract on white mice induced with E. coli pathogen”. This experimental research utilized an A positivist fisherman standing on a river bank describes (without getting his/her feet wet) the social properties of a species of fish by observing the general tendency of their group behaviour as they swim around. 3 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D.

The experimental group was given a treatment (l eaf extracts) while the control was left untreated. The ontology of this research was realism, the epistemology was objectivism, and a quantitative methodology governed the research process.

Post-Positivist Paradigm Post-positivism, as Willis (2007) describes it is a “milder form of positivism “that follows the same principles but allows more interaction between the researcher and his/her research participants. It uses additional methods such as survey research and qualitative methods such as interviewing and participant- observation (Creswell, 2008). This paradigm is t he modified scientific method for the social sciences . It aims to produce objective and generalizable knowledge about social patterns, seeking to affirm the presence of universal properties/laws in relationships amongst pre- defined variables. This epistemology is manifested by quasi -experimental research designs that utilize treatment, outcome measures and experimental units, but do not use random assignment to create comparison from which treatment caused change is inferred. It is very similar to the positivist approach of comparing mean scores but depends on non-equivalent groups that differ from each other in many ways other than the presence of the treatment whose effects are being tested (Depoy & Gitlin, 1998). T he quality standards of this paradigm are objectivity, validity and reliability, which can be modified with the use of triangulation of data, methods and theories. An exemplar is the second author’s graduate research at the University of Southeastern Philippines, entitled ‘ The effectiveness of conceptual approach of teaching on the scores of students in a biotechnology achievement test ’. Two groups were established, the experimental A post-positivist fisherman supplements his/her quantitative observations of the social properties of a species of fish by wearing a wet suit and conducting structured interviews of a random sample of fish to ascertain their reasons for swimming in accordance with the inferred social pattern. 4 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D.

To test the achievement of the students, a teacher -made test was designed and subjected to content and construct validity analysis. The two groups were tested and the data were analysed using statistics. Most often, graduate research in the Philippines is designed in this way. RELATIVELY NEW PARADIGMS The Interpretive Paradigm This humanistic paradigm arrived in educational research during the late 1970s, influenced strongly by anthropology which aims to understand other cultures, from the inside. That is, to understand the culturally different ’other’ by learning to ‘s tand in their shoes’, ‘look through their eyes’ and ‘feel their pleasure or pain’. Thus the epistemology of this paradigm is inter -subjective knowledge construction. Interpretive knowledge of the other is produced through a prolonged process of interaction undertaken by ethnographers who immerse themselves within the culture they are studying. Using ethnographic methods of informal interviewing, participant observation and establishing ethically sound relationships, interpretive researchers construct trust worthy and authentic accounts of the cultural other. Applied to educational research, this paradigm enables researchers to build rich local understandings of the life- world experiences of teachers and students and of the cultures of classrooms, schools and the communities they serve. The quality standards that regulate interpretive knowledge construction are varied, but arguably the most well -known and coherent are those of Guba and Lincoln (1989) who developed standards of trustworthiness and authenticity that are distinctly different but ‘parallel to’ the validity, reliability and objectivity standards of positivism. The trustworthiness criteria include: credibility (", "source": "IJMCETaylorMedina2013.pdf"}, {"id": 278, "text": "erve.

The authenticity criteria focus on the ethics of the relationship established by the researcher with his/her participants and include: fairness (are the informants represented fairly?), educative (did the participants benefit by learning about their social world?), catalytic (did the participants benefit by identifying problems associated with their social world?), and tactical (did the research empower the participants to improve their social situation?) (Guba & Lincoln, 1989; Josselson, 2007). The authenticity criteria have a strong resonance with the standards of the critical paradigm outlined below Recent developments in the interpretive parad igm have highlighted the importance of the researcher’s own subjectivity in the (hermeneutic) process of interpretation, and have emphasised its progressive development as a key part of the inquiry process, thereby adding to the emergent and reflective qua lity of interpretive research.

What hidden assumptions are cons training (distorting) the way I make sense of the other? Interpretive research methods include’ narrative inquiry’ and ‘writing as inquiry’, especially autobiographic and auto -ethnographic methods (Ellis & Bochner, 2000; Clandinin & Connolly, 1998; Richardson, 2000; Taylor & Settelmaier, 2003). Applied to education, interpretive inquiry engages teachers as reflective practitioners in developing enhanced understanding of the life -worlds of their students by constantly asking questions such as: Who are these students who sit before me? Who is the self that teaches? (Palmer, 1998). A deeper understanding involves a broader focus on the social, political, historic and economic forces shaping the pedagogies, curriculum policies and schooling system in which teachers are immersed. Such an interpretive orientation is essential for teachers wishing to adopt 6 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D. (2013). Educational research paradigms: From positivism to multiparadigmatic .

The Critical Paradigm To resolve the global crises we are facing today we need to produce graduates capable not only of conducting scientific research reasoned out thr ough objective quantitative strategies or engaging in interpretive research that deepens mutual understanding. The added challenge for educational research is to empower our students and colleagues to become imaginative and critical thinkers capable of add ressing the question: ‘Whose interests are not being (and should be) served by particular social policies and practices?’The critical research paradigm addresses this issue by enabling the researcher to practice ‘deep democracy’ (Kincheloe & McLaren, 2000) which involves identifying and transforming socially unjust social structures, policies, beliefs and practices. Its primary purpose is to identify, contest and help resolve ‘gross power imbalances’ in society which fuel ethically questionable profit - making activities that contribute to systemic inequalities and injustices such as social and economic exclusion of some sectors of society, loss of cultural capital and cultural identity amongst ethnic minorities, and anthropocentric climate change and loss of biodiversity. In this type of research, the process of writing as inquiry (shared with the interpretive paradigm) has an added critical dimension and becomes a means of critical analysis and ideology critique of established policy and practice. The researcher raises his/her own critical consciousness (Brook field, 2000) and constructs a moral vision of a better society. This can be done individually or, better still, in collaboration with less empowered others participating in ‘critical action research’ led by the researcher in the role of facilitator. The researcher’s role is The critical fisherman empowers the fish to organise themselves as a lobby group and protest to the Fisheries’ Department, and s/he advocates on their behalf to have the river cleaned up. 7 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D.

The work of Jose Rizal (the national hero of the Philippines) and Patrick Awuah (founder of Ashesi University, Ghana) are good examples of this type of transformative leadership. Applied to education, critical inquiry focuses first on raising the conscious awareness of teachers about established values and beliefs that underpin their seemingly natural teacher -centred classroom roles (Taylor, 2008). Once this process is underway, critical theory is introduced (e.g., critical pedagogy, cultural inclusiveness, social justice) that stimulates teachers’ creative thinking about designing curricula and assessment that are more student -centred, inquiry oriented, culturally sensitive, community-oriented, socially responsible, etc. The rigor of this type of research is evaluated in terms of quality standards that are very di fferent from those of the positivist paradigm but which are congruent with the standards of the interpretive paradigm. It is important that the researcher demonstrates critical self-awareness and critical understanding of the complexity of social issues. B ut critique alone is not enough to nourish the soul, and so it is important for the critical researcher to develop a vision of a better way of teaching and learning, and research practices, a vision based explicitly on moral principles that support the ‘shoulds/oughts’ of a transformed professional practice. And in order to avoid criticism of being an armchair academic or utopian, the critical researcher is well advised to take direct action, to ‘make a difference’, by enacting his/her ideals in a principled endeavour to transform the culture of his/her classroom community through, for example, critical action research. This involves evaluating the impact of one’s transformative teaching on student learning and, ideally, leads to the teacher -researcher’s evolving praxis.

Critical researchers also choose to write in a way that is designed to elicit critical awareness and critical understanding in their readers, thereby writing for pedagogical thoughtfulness (Manen, 1990). 8 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D.

Journal for Meaning- Centered Education,1. http://www.meaningcentered.org/journal/ volume-01/educational-research-paradigms-from-positivism-to- multiparadigmatic/ Various literary styles of writing are available to critical and interpretive writers to enable them to impact their readership, and this is taken up in the postmodern paradigm below. The Postmodern Paradigm This relatively new and challenging paradigm opens many new and exciting doors for educational researchers as it brings to our attention the very important concept of ‘representation’ (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005) which holds that what goes on in our minds and hearts is not directly accessible to the world outside us. There is no window i n our heads that allows another person to look directly into our minds and see ‘exactly what we mean’; the best we can do is ‘represent’ our thoughts and feelings through various means of communication (e.g., language, art, dance, gesture). Equally for s cientists, there is no window into nature that directly reveals nature’s secrets; all scientific observations are ‘theory laden’ whether conducted using the human eye or technological extensions such as radio telescopes, electron microscopes, cloud chamber s, x-ray crystallography, gamma spectroscopy, etc. Thus scientific knowledge is at best a model of the ‘unseeable’ and its viability (or usefulness) is tested against the human purposes that shape its production. Scientific knowledge remains forever contin gent and open to challenge; and in that way it continues to evolve, sometimes making radical departures that overturn established models. Such is the case with our scientific knowledge of the cosmos and the sub -atomic universe (Dosch & Muller, 2010).

Scientific knowledge remains forever contin gent and open to challenge; and in that way it continues to evolve, sometimes making radical departures that overturn established models. Such is the case with our scientific knowledge of the cosmos and the sub -atomic universe (Dosch & Muller, 2010). When educational research is under the governance of the positivist paradigm the scientific form of representation prevails: research reports are written objectively using the passive voice, past tense and third -person gender neutral pronoun (‘it’). However, with the advent of newer paradigms, alternative means of representation are available to us. The interpretive paradigm requires that our personal perspectives, along with those of our research participants, are ‘given voice’. Writing narratively (1 st person voice) about our unfolding experiences enables us 9 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D. (2013). Educational research paradigms: From positivism to multiparadigmatic .

And for those who are drawn to the critical paradigm, a major goal of the ‘researcher as activist’ is to empower self and others by enabling ‘critical voices’ to be heard; voices of prot est that point to personal experiences of oppression and the need for changes to policies and practices to ensure equity, fairness and social justice. Interpretive and critical researchers draw from the full range of pronouns (I, you, she, he, it, they), active and passive voice, and multiple tenses (past, present, future), depending on the (unfolding) purpose of their inquiries.

The choice can be overwhelming for the novice researcher and quite confronting for ‘elders of the tribe’ still steeped in the positivist paradigm. But more so, in celebrating pluralism and difference, the postmodern paradigm opens the door to other disciplines such as The Arts. In recent years Arts -based educational research has flourished, making available many new forms of repr esentation such as:(i) literary genres of impressionist writing, autobiographical writing, storying, poetry, ethno-drama, screenplay and fiction, and (ii) visual imagery such as film, painting, sketching, dance and photography (Knowles, & Cole, 2008; Prendergast, Leggo, & Sameshima, 2009). Another important contribution of the Arts to educational research is the availability of alternative modes of reasoning. The positivist paradigm privileges a particular form of reasoning - propositional, deductive an d analytic logic- which serves well the purpose of reasoning objectively. However, interpretive and critical inquiries, with their emphasis on representing the progressive development of the researcher’s professional practice, require alternative modes of reasoning such as metaphorical thinking, dialectical 10 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D.

For example, if we write up our research using a literary genre (e.g., narrative, story or poetry) for the purpose of engaging our readers in critical reflective thinking about their own professional practice then the critical par adigm quality standard of pedagogical thoughtfulness is relevant (Manen, 1990).

The literary quality of our writing that serves this purpose needs to have resonance with the experiences of the reader. In other words, we aim to write in a way that seems to the reader to be realistic, plausible or believable. The quality standard of verisimilitude is relevant to this purpose (B arone, 2001). Arts -based research provides many more quality standards for shaping the educative and literary quality of our research writing, thereby enriching the work of interpretive and critical researchers. They direct us to question our writing: Is the story engaging (dramatic, fun, odd)? Does the reader gain emotional appreciation such as empathic appreciation? Does the writing make the topic more complex (subtle, nuanced, deeper)? Multi-Paradigmatic Research Rather than standing alone as individual paradigms for framing the design of a researcher’s inquiry, as does the positivist paradigm, the newer paradigms can serve as ‘refer ents’. In other words, we can design our research by combining methods and quality standards drawn from two or more of the newer paradigms. It is not uncommon for a research study to combine methods and standards from the interpretive and critical paradig ms to create a ‘critical auto/ethnography’. And when new literary genres, modes of thinking and quality standards are added from Arts - based research such multi -paradigmatic studies become very powerful means of transformative professional development (Taylor, Taylor, & Luitel, 2012). 11 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D.

Theorising about culturally inclusive teaching fuelled Berhana’s vision of her future science curriculum, one that includes the indigenous knowledge of students from the local community. As my writing evolved I came to understand that culture plays a vital role in promoting a constructivist informed curriculum and classroom practices. With this, I envisage a classroom where my students use their local knowledge (non- Western), such as their culture, beliefs, traditions, in concert with global (Western) knowledge in understanding the environment and in making sense of the world around them (Brickhouse & Kittles on, 2006). However, it will also be a classroom where students are made to realise though science and science education can bring prosperity, it can also bring annihilation depending on whose interest is being served (Beane, 1995). I believe that such type of classroom might help develop responsible decision makers and students who will see science as a means of understanding the inclusivity of both knowledge systems in attaining better lives on earth (Jardine, 1998).

Also missing is an account of the new ‘integral paradigm’ that provides a rationale for drawing upon multiple paradigms to design new hybrid methodologie s that involve multiple epistemologies and their accompanying quality standards. For more on this see Taylor, Taylor and Luitel (2012). Returning to our purpose in writing this paper, we join Paul and Marfo (2001) in calling for graduate research program s to provide diverse philosophies of research and knowledge production. In making our education systems more ethically responsive to the urgent challenges of globalization – designing sustainable development, countering climate change, preventing ongoing loss of biocultural diversity - we cannot afford to simply look to the past for ‘know - how’.

For example, Robert Frodeman (2008) explai ns how philosophers and environmental scientists have joined forces to create the new interdisciplinary field of ‘environmental philosophy’ that is enabling local communities to resolve the complex problem of sustainable development, with its competing eco nomic, environmental and socio -cultural interests. We need education systems that actively prepare young people with the social and cognitive skills to engage critically and imaginatively in ethical decision -making about complex issues facing their societi es. By drawing on multiple paradigms educational researchers can make a major contribution to aligning curricula, teacher education, and classroom teaching and 13 Taylor, P.C., & Medina, M.N.D. (2013).

The Paradigm or the Approach? Donna M. Mertens1 The mixed methods community is awash in discussions about philosophical frameworks or paradigms that provide guidance for mixed methods approaches (B. Johnson & Gray, 2010). Part of the reason for the multiplicity of viewpoints about the role of paradigms in mixed meth- ods research emanates from the different uses of the termparadigm. When Thomas Kuhn (1962) brought this term into the academic community through his book,The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, he gave it a particular meaning that characterized a paradigm as a world- view that embodied the beliefs of scientists. He added that different scientists who held differ- ent worldviews would be unable to communicate with each other because of the fundamental differences in their definitions of reality and methodology. He argued that the scientific com- munity experienced paradigm shifts when a phenomenon could no longer be understood using past methods and new methods would emerge. Guba and Lincoln’s (1989, 2005) adaptation of the idea of paradigms to the social sciences retained the idea of paradigms as worldviews that reflect researchers’ assumptions about reality and methodology, and they added two other cate- gories of assumptions that constitute a paradigm: assumptions about ethics and epistemology. However, they rejected the idea that researchers would replace one dominating method from the past with a new approach. Rather, they described paradigms in terms of assumptions related to ethics, reality (ontology), and epistemology that lead to different assumptions about the nature of systematic inquiry (Mertens & Wilson, 2012). Hence, Guba and Lincoln set the stage for recognition of different paradigms that start with different philosophical assumptions and that lead to different methodological assumptions and methods choices. This concept of paradigms contrasts with the idea that there are three paradigms: quantita- tive, qualitative, and mixed methods (Biesta, 2010; Freshwater & Cahill, 2012; Greene & Hall, 2010).

This concept of paradigms contrasts with the idea that there are three paradigms: quantita- tive, qualitative, and mixed methods (Biesta, 2010; Freshwater & Cahill, 2012; Greene & Hall, 2010). In this editorial, I argue against the school of thought that paradigms can be methodolo- gical in their foundations. I am in agreement with Greene and Hall (2010) who wrote, To use the qualitative and quantitative [and mixed methods] labels for paradigms is to reify and essen- tialize them and thereby disregard their constructed nature and discount the diverse histories and social locations of different kinds of qualitative and quantitative inquiry. (p. 125) As Biesta (2010) notes, the termsquantitative and qualitative denote kinds of data, not the epistemologies, methodologies, designs, and ontological assumptions that are associated with different research frameworks. 1Gallaudet University, Washington DC, USA Corresponding Author: Donna M. Mertens, Department of Education, Gallaudet University, 800 Florida Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20002, USA Email: donna.mertens@gallaudet.edu In the mixed methods world, three paradigmatic stances that are rooted in contrasting philo- sophical assumptions have been developed: dialectical pluralism that stands at the nexus of the constructivist and postpositivist paradigms (Greene & Hall, 2010), the pragmatic paradigm (Biesta, 2010), 1 and the transformative paradigm (Mertens, 2009; Mertens, Bledsoe, Sullivan, & Wilson, 2010). These three paradigmatic stances answer the arguments about incommensurabil- ity of paradigms through their characterization of mixed methods as a methodological approach that is compatible with different sets of philosophical assumptions. Greene and Hall (2010) describe a dialectic stance as follows: A dialectic stance actively welcomes more than one paradigmatic tradition and mental model, along with more than one methodology and type of method, into the same inquiry space and engages them in respectful dialogue one with the other throughout the inquiry.

(p. 124) This stance allows the researcher to adhere to the beliefs of the postpositivist paradigm in conducting quantitative-oriented data collection and the constructivist in qualitative-oriented data collection and then to put the two in conversation with each other throughout the study to allow for deeper understandings based on the convergence and dissonance found in the approaches. The pragmatic paradigm has been put forth as a philosophical framework that supports the use of mixed methods based on the assumption that there is not one set of methods that is appropriate; rather, the criteria for choosing methods include the following: What fits with the research question in this study (R. B. Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004)? Bieste (2010), Greene and Hall (2010), and Denzin (2012) warn against an overly simplistic application of the prag- matic philosophy to research, as in: If the method fits the question, then use it. Biesta outlines the basic principles of pragmatism as a philosophy that can inform mixed methods researchers because Dewey held that no knowledge claim can be documented as providing the ‘‘truth.’’ Rather, different knowledge claims result from different ways of engaging with the social world. The transformative paradigm has also been offered as a way of thinking about research that could lead to decisions to use mixed methods, if the use of those methods would support the enhancement of human rights and social justice (Mertens, 2009; Mertens et al., 2010; Mertens & Wilson, 2012). The philosophical assumptions associated with the transformative paradigm emanate from an ethical stance that emphasizes the pursuit of social justice and the furtherance of human rights. Based on this axiological assumption, the researcher is able to derive implica- tions for the nature of reality, knowledge, and systematic inquiry that are commensurate with this ethical stance. Hence, the nature of reality is looked upon as being multifaceted and reflec- tive of different power positionalities in society. Consequences of accepting different versions of reality over another are evaluated in terms of their ability to challenge oppressive systems, thus leading to an epistemological assumption that includes involvement in communities in cul- tura", "source": "mertens-2012-what-comes-first-the-paradigm-or-the-approach.pdf"}, {"id": 296, "text": "te with this ethical stance.

Consequences of accepting different versions of reality over another are evaluated in terms of their ability to challenge oppressive systems, thus leading to an epistemological assumption that includes involvement in communities in cul- turally respectful ways. Typically, mixed methods designs will be associated with the transfor- mative paradigm because of the need to capture experiences in both qualitative and quantitative ways in order to represent the complexity of the social issues and solutions to ongoing problems. In conclusion, I argue that the use of paradigms as philosophical frameworks that delineate assumptions about ethics, reality, knowledge, and systematic inquiry helps clarify the basis of disagreements amongst members of the mixed methods research community. One paradigmatic position is not correct and the others wrong. However, continued debate about these frameworks provides fertile ground for expanding our understandings of the value and challenges associated with mixed methods research. 256 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 6(4) Note 1. To be fair, Biesta (2010) argues that the principles of pragmatism as a philosophy are useful to mixed methods researchers, while at the same time describing the concept of paradigm as an unhelpful con- cept because the broad categories of paradigms used in the mixed methods literature tend to combine heterogeneous assumptions and do not allow for conversations across assumptions.

This paradigm is compared with three existing mixed methods paradigms: the dialectic stance, critical realism, and pragmatism. The performative paradigm assumes the existence of multiple realities that can be known in various ways. In a research inquiry, researchers create new, unknown worlds, which they subsequently investigate. Through research, an ever-higher degree of objectivity is obtained in successive ‘‘mangles,’’ rounds of feedback, in which the researcher listens to the created world’s feedback and adapts his or her research models accordingly. Across and within research inquiries, many and various kinds of mangles can be combined, including mangles qualitative and mangles quantitative in nature. Keywords performative paradigm, mixed methods research, objectivity, mangle of practice This article introduces a performative paradigm for mixed methods research. The development of this paradigm started with four existing, fruitful ideas regarding reality, realities, their role in scientific inquiry, and my feeling that there was no one paradigm that provided room for these four ideas in combination. The first idea is that of mixed methods researchers as pragmatists who set aside ontological and epistemological issues (Bryman, 2007). The second idea refers to the important role of a researcher’s beliefs, assumptions, and values in understanding research and its outcomes (Lincoln, 2010). The third is the idea that people live, in part, in different worlds rather than having different views of the one and same reality (Nicholls, 2017; Yin, 2016). The fourth idea is that the research process can be seen as a process in which reality ‘‘talks back’’ to the researcher (Pickering, 1995). The first part of this article discusses the characteristics, possibilities, and limitations of three existing paradigms for mixed methods research: the dialectic stance, critical realism, and prag- matism.

In the second part of this article, the performative paradigm is introduced and its char- acteristics, possibilities, and limitations are explained in detail. This paradigm is based on the notion ofperformativity, as developed by philosopher of science Andrew Pickering (1995). It is not related to performativity in the sense of the power of discourse to constrain what it describes (Butler, 1993). 1University of Vienna, Wien, Austria Corresponding Author: Judith Schoonenboom, Department of Education, University of Vienna, Sensengasse 3a, 1090 Wien, Austria. Email: judith.schoonenboom@univie.ac.at The Dialectic Stance From a dialectic stance, mixed methods inquiry is viewed as a dialogue between paradigms. Thus, although the dialectic stance will be called a paradigm in this article, it could also be called a ‘‘meta-paradigm’’ (Johnson, 2017). The dialectic stance is described by Greene (2007) as follows: Paradigms are constituted by sets of interconnected philosophical assumptions regarding reality, knowledge, methodology, and values. The assumptive sets of different paradigms are different in important ways, but paradigms themselves are historical and social constructions and so are not inviolate or sacrosanct. Paradigmatic assumptions importantly guide and direct practical inquiry decisions, along with context and theory. Important paradigm differences should be respectfully and intentionally used together to engage meaningfully with difference and, through the tensions created by juxtaposing different paradigms, to achieve dialectical discovery of enhanced, reframed, or new understandings. (p. 69) Greene (2007) provides a real-life example of mixed methods research, in which two para- digms, each with a distinct view of reality and how it can be known, are brought into dialogue: a constructivist view, in which multiple realities exist that can be known in various ways, and a postpositivist view, which assumes the existence of one reality that can be known objectively. In this example of dialectic mixed methods resear", "source": "schoonenboom-2017-a-performative-paradigm-for-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 300, "text": "al-life example of mixed methods research, in which two para- digms, each with a distinct view of reality and how it can be known, are brought into dialogue: a constructivist view, in which multiple realities exist that can be known in various ways, and a postpositivist view, which assumes the existence of one reality that can be known objectively. In this example of dialectic mixed methods research, the postpositivist aim of obtaining objec- tive, timeless knowledge about the state of reality is brought into dialogue with the constructi- vist aim of obtaining an intersubjective understanding of multiple and varied realities. The two views on what reality is (or realities are) give rise to two distinct research methodologies, each characterized by its own assumptions, aspirations, and research methods. Greene (2015) describes this for the real-life example as follows: With its realist assumptions and its aspirations for inferences that are generalizable, postpositivism generally calls for structured, quantitative methods and data that support the comparative causal inferences desired by the philanthropic funder of the program. With its interpretive assumptions and its aspirations for inferences that represent understanding of contextual meaningfulness, con- structivism generally calls for unstructured, qualitative methods and data that represent the evalua- tion team’s commitments to contextual understanding and honoring of the diversity of experience. (p. 611-612) These distinct research methodologies require that research be performed for each methodol- ogy separately in a distinct research strand, before their findings are brought into dialogue: With respect to methodologies, the mixed evaluation team selects a quasi-experimental methodol- ogy for the postpositivist strand of the evaluation and mini-case studies for the constructivist strand. (Greene, 2015, p. 612) In order for a mixed methods researcher or research team to be able to bring two separate research strands with different views and methodologies into dialogue, they must be somehow able to alternately adopt these views and switch between views. Such a conception, however, gives rise to a number of problems. First, switching between two distinct methodologies is not what researchers typically experience when they are conducting mixed methods research.

Schoonenboom 285 A second problem is that for researchers, their ontological and epistemological views are deep-rooted stances (Lincoln, 2010). Although deep-rooted stances may change over time, they typically take time for one to abandon and cannot easily be reversed, making it unlikely for an individual researcher to switch between these stances within a research project. A third question is how the results of the distinct methodologies applied in distinct research strands are finally combined into one integrated whole. The combination of results that have been obtained using different research methods or methodologies is a fundamental characteris- tic of mixed methods research that is known as ‘‘integration’’ (Bazeley, 2012; Bazeley & Kemp, 2012; Fetters, Curry, & Creswell, 2013; Maxwell, Chmiel, & Rogers, 2015; O’Cathain, Murphy, & Nicholl, 2010). For the dialectic-stance paradigm, integration is a tricky problem, as the mixed methods research process demands that results and conclusions from different methodologies with different assumptions, ontologies, and epistemologies be brought together. However, the question is how this can be possible given their distinct origins. Another question is what view of reality applies to the integrated result. That is, what assumptions, ontology, and epistemology underlie the integrated result? Finally, while good examples of going back and forth between qualitative and quantitative research strands have been described in the literature (Greene, 2015; Hesse-Biber, 2010, 2012; Maxwell et al., 2015), accurate descriptions of the corresponding changes in ontology and epis- temology are missing.

Thus, mixed methods research practice has not yet provided evidence for this switch between different ontologies and epistemologies. Critical Realism A second paradigm for mixed methods research stems from critical realism, which assumes that there is one objective reality that can be known in various ways (Campbell, 1988). Much like the postpositivist view within the dialect-stance paradigm, the aim of critical realist mixed methods research is to obtain knowledge of a reality that is taken to exist in an independent, objective way. Contrary to the postpositivist view, knowledge in the critical realist paradigm is always provisional (Popper, 1963) and can be very diverse in nature, with reality capable of being known in many different ways. Critical realism emphasizes that reality includes experi- ences and feelings about which scientific knowledge can be gained. A critical realist paradigm for mixed methods research has been developed by Joseph Maxwell (Maxwell, 2012; Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). In the words of Maxwell (2012), Critical realists thus retain an ontological realism (there is a real world that exists independently of our perceptions, theories, and constructions) while accepting a form of epistemological constructi- vism and relativism (our understanding of this world is inevitably a construction from our own per- spectives and standpoint). (p. 5) Critical realism solves a number of problems of the dialectic-stance paradigm. Different from the dialectic-stance paradigm, the critical realist paradigm does not assume switching between distinct ontologies and epistemologies. In the critical realist paradigm, there is only one ontology and one epistemology, namely, that there is an objective reality that can be known in various ways. The utilization of multiple and mixed methods is legitimate, as quantitative and qualitative methods represent different ways of knowing.

The utilization of multiple and mixed methods is legitimate, as quantitative and qualitative methods represent different ways of knowing. Thus, Lincoln’s (2010) problem of an improbable switch between deep-rooted beliefs has disappeared in the critical realist para- digm. Methods are no longer specifically linked to, or considered more appropriate for, a par- ticular ontology or epistemology. In a critical realist paradigm, it is clear where to situate the outcomes of integration. Like everything else, integration takes place in one independently 286 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 13(3) existing, objective reality, involving results that have been obtained via the various ways in which the objective reality can be known. The critical realist paradigm, however, gives rise to new problems, including problems that are not encountered in the dialectic-stance paradigm. Like in all realist paradigms, research in the critical realist paradigm is guided by the notion of an objective reality. The researcher’s aim is to develop a better understanding of this objective reality. The following question then arises: How can it be determined if one inquiry has achieved a better understanding? If the notion of an objective reality is of any use, it should be possible to derive criteria from this objective real- ity from which researchers can judge whether a specific inquiry has led to a better, or perhaps a worse, understanding of reality. However, the problem is that researchers do not have direct access to this objective reality. Researchers do not possess a ‘‘God’s eye view’’ (Putnam, 1981) that shows them how reality ‘‘really’’ is, and therefore objective reality cannot be used to derive such criteria (Chakravartty, 2014). As a result, the notion of an objective reality has a problem of legitimacy. The question in turn is whether it makes sense to assume an objective reality: What can be gained by assuming an objective reality that should but cannot guide the conduct of research? This argument has been rebutted by realists on the basis of various arguments. First, realists have stated that their position is not guided by objective reality but rather by the empirical suc- cess of the sciences. Given their success, our best theories must be true. Otherwise, the success of our theories would be a miracle (Chakrav", "source": "schoonenboom-2017-a-performative-paradigm-for-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 304, "text": "e reality that should but cannot guide the conduct of research? This argument has been rebutted by realists on the basis of various arguments. First, realists have stated that their position is not guided by objective reality but rather by the empirical suc- cess of the sciences. Given their success, our best theories must be true. Otherwise, the success of our theories would be a miracle (Chakravartty, 2014). Furthermore, given the successes of science, the hypothesis of scientific realism should be accepted as an accurate portrayal of the relationship between science and reality (Sankey, 2004). However, one could also take these arguments as simultaneously counterarguments showing the irrelevance of an objective reality to the daily business of science. A second problem relates to the critical realist view on multiple realities. Among qualitative researchers, there is a widespread notion that there is not one world, but multiple subjective rea- lities (e.g., Nicholls, 2017). Thus, the realities of a study’s participants may differ dramatically from the reality of the researcher. Furthermore, there may be differences among participants (Yin, 2016). This notion of multiple realities, however, is rejected by critical realism. In Maxwell’s (2012) words: Thus, while critical realism rejects the idea of ‘‘multiple realities,’’ in the sense of independent and incommensurable worlds that are socially constructed by different individuals or societies, it is quite compatible with the idea that there are different valid perspectives on reality. (p. 9) One argument against the critical realist position is that there are situations in which the notion of multiple realities makessense. It makes sense to assume that participants in qualita- tive research to some extent live in different realities, with different concepts, habits, interests, and values, rather than claiming that they look differently at one objective reality. Assuming such differences especially makes sense if the aim of an inquiry is to describe these different realities. What would such a description gain from an ‘‘additional’’ objective reality? This does not mean that participants always live in different realities, nor does it mean that multiple reali- ties are assumed in all qualitative research (Yin, 2016).

It just means that, in certain situations, the assumption of different realities may be a fruitful standpoint. Pragmatism In the pragmatist paradigm (Morgan, 2007, 2014), the notion of various ontologies and epis- temologies is abandoned and replaced by inquiry into the nature and consequences of human Schoonenboom 287 actions in a social context. The aim of research in the pragmatist paradigm is not to obtain time- less knowledge, but rather to solve temporary problems, understanding research as involving a succession of experiences where previous beliefs are revised based on specific research actions. During the conduct of research, pragmatist researchers regularly have to switch from their research outcomes to their current beliefs, to see whether the former match the latter. If the out- comes do not match the researcher’s current beliefs, these beliefs have to be updated. These updated beliefs, then, become the new ‘‘current beliefs,’’ and they form the basis for a new round of data analysis, or a new experiment. This process is repeated until the temporary prob- lem has been solved. The pragmatist process of updating beliefs based on research outcomes aligns quite naturally with how the aim of conducting research is commonly viewed. In many if not all paradigms, the outcomes of research inquiry are used to modify existing ‘‘beliefs’’ (pragmatism), ‘‘intersubjective understanding’’ (constructivism), or ‘‘objective knowledge’’ (postpositivism). In contrast to the dialectic stance and critical realism, pragmatism offers a fundamental cri- terion that can be used to determine whether or not research has been successful. In the pragma- tist paradigm, progress can be defined as progress made in solving the temporary problem. Research can be said to be successful to the extent that it contributes to solving the temporary problem. Consequently, the critical realist problem—that research should be guided by some- thing that is unable to guide it (the objective reality)—vanishes in the pragmatist paradigm.

Research can be said to be successful to the extent that it contributes to solving the temporary problem. Consequently, the critical realist problem—that research should be guided by some- thing that is unable to guide it (the objective reality)—vanishes in the pragmatist paradigm. In the pragmatist paradigm, research is guided by the problem that it is attempting to solve. In this regard, it is quite possible to identify criteria for evaluating the extent to which an inquiry con- tributes to solving the problem. In determining criteria for validity based on a research problem, the pragmatist paradigm, unlike the critical realist paradigm, does not refer to an objective reality. In the pragmatist paradigm, methodologies are not seen as separate entities that should be kept apart in their own research strands. Instead, research approaches are seen as relatively flex- ible configurations, and one research approach may combine elements of one methodology with elements of another methodology. Whether specific combinations of research elements are allowed in research is decided in the pragmatist paradigm at the level of the research commu- nity, which is assumed to hold shared beliefs about valid starting points of inquiry and legiti- mate research actions (Morgan, 2014). Elements from various methodologies can be combined as long as their combination forms part of the community’s shared beliefs. Thus, while research- ers in the dialectic-stance paradigm switch between distinct methodologies, such a practice is abandoned in the pragmatist paradigm. The pragmatist paradigm, however, has its own unique issues. First, following Lincoln’s (2010) notion that ontological and epistemological views are deep-rooted stances, one would expect that, by now, various mixed methods research communities would have been identified on the basis of their deep-rooted beliefs about which specific combinations of elements from positivist and constructivist methodologies are allowed. That this has not happened yet casts doubt on the idea that a research community is characterized by a set of shared beliefs. Second, the pragmatist notion of combining elements from different methodologies is proble- matic.

Second, the pragmatist notion of combining elements from different methodologies is proble- matic. It is not clear how one could combine a research element that assumes that there is one reality that can be known objectively with a research element that assumes that there are multi- ple constructed realities. One cannot believe at the same time that there isboth one realityand multiple realities. These beliefs are inconsistent and a set of shared beliefs that contains both is not trustworthy, unless these beliefs are interpreted in a special way. This does not contradict the both/and principle of dialectical pluralism, which states that mixed methods researchers should expect, accept, and work with differences in virtually every realm of inquiry, including reality (Johnson, 2017; Johnson & Schoonenboom, 2016). According to the both/and principle, 288 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 13(3) a researcher accepts and works with differences, for example, works with researchers who have different ontologies and epistemologies. The message of this paragraph is different, stating that a researcher as a person or a research community as an entity cannot hold inconsistent beliefs, such as that there is both one reality and multiple realities. Third, in addition to the issue that no mixed methods research communities have been defined based on their shared beliefs, the notion of shared beliefs itself is problematic. The notion of shared beliefs as constitutional of a community, including communities of mixed methods researchers, has been attacked most passionately and successfully by Joseph Maxwell (Maxwell, 2012; Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). Culture is not shared, but it is participated in (Aberle, 1960), and sharing is only one possible form of participation (Maxwell, 2012). Rather than by shared goals, a culture is characterized by diversity. There is no evidence of a func- tional necessity of shared goals, motives, or beliefs (Wallace, 1970). This makes shared beliefs within a research community as the starting point of inquiry and legitimate research actions problematic.

Last, with the pragmatist disappearance of ontologies and epistemologies, the idea of multi- ple realities disappears as well. Consequently, unlike constructivism, pragmatism cannot accom- modate this common and useful starting point of qualitative inquiry. The Performative Paradigm A Performative Ontology and Epistemology Like pragmatism, the performative paradigm focuses on research actions. Unlike pragmatism, however, it assumes a specific, constructivist ontology and epistemology. The performative paradigm assumes the existence of multiple realities that can be known and investigated in vari- ous ways. It agrees with the idea of multiple realities, the idea that people to some extent live in different realities, with different concepts, habits, interests, and values, rather than claiming that they look differently at a single objective reality. These different realities are dynamic and changeable. Moreover, the concepts researchers use to speak about these realities are not fixed, but change as these realities change. Realities are thus multiple, varied, and changing. This ontology and epistemology are borrowed from dialectical pluralism (Johnson, 2017). The performative paradigm solves a number of the problems of the previous paradigms. In the performative paradigm, mixed methods researchers do not switch between ontologies, epis- temologies, or research stances. Rather, they stay and live in multiple realities that can be known in various ways. This lack of a switch corresponds to the experiences of Bryman’s (2007) mixed methods researchers and to Lincoln’s (2010) argument that a researcher does not switch stances. While the performative paradigm, with its focus on temporality, comes close in nature to the pragmatist paradigm, it differs from pragmatism in that different worlds, and research as an attempt to better understand the laws and habits of worlds, play an important role. Whereas in the pragmatist paradigm, the outside world is formed by the experiences of researchers and their social context, the performative paradigm assumes the existence of distinct worlds.

Whereas in the pragmatist paradigm, the outside world is formed by the experiences of researchers and their social context, the performative paradigm assumes the existence of distinct worlds. As opposed to the external, objective reality of critical realism, the distinct worlds of the performa- tive paradigm are viewed as temporary and created. In the performative paradigm, worlds are not objectively given, but arise from the concepts that researchers use to speak about them in a specific, time-bound context. These concepts are viewed asconstituting concepts, as they con- stitute worlds. The performative paradigm assumes that researchers’ concepts are intersubjec- tive in the sense that they are sharable. In line with Maxwell’s argument, this does not mean that constituting concepts are shared by all members of a specific community, nor does it mean that all people who know a specific concept have a shared definition of it. Rather, it means that Schoonenboom 289 researchers can share a concept and develop criteria for judging whether someone understands a concept (e.g., if a person uses it in a correct way, is able to explain the concept, or is able to provide examples; Wittgenstein, 1953). Precisely because concepts can be used in various ways, it is often necessary that researchers explain what they mean by a specific concept in a specific context. Putnam (1987) provides an example in which the answer to the question how many objects exist in a given world might dif- fer depending on the definition of what an object is. For purposes of demonstration, Putnam’s example is simplified. Assume that there is a world which contains the objects A, B, C, A, C, and C. A researcher may ask, ‘‘How many objects exist in this world?’’ This question has two interpretations, depending on what is meant byobject. In this example, the researcher may inter- pret object to mean ‘‘different types of objects,’’ in which case the answer to the question is three, namely, A, B, and C. Using terminology borrowed from linguistics, this world contains three different object types.

Using terminology borrowed from linguistics, this world contains three different object types. Alternatively, the researcher may interpretobject as referring to each separate instantiation of an object type, or in linguistic terms, to each separatetoken.I n that case, the answer would be six, namely, A, B, C, A, C, and C. Under this interpretation, this world contains sixtoken objects. This means that, to avoid confusion, a researcher should make clear whether he or she refers to type objects or token objects. In that case, according to Putnam (1987), Once we make clear how we are using ‘‘object’’ (or ‘‘exist’’), the question ‘‘How many objects exist?’’ has an answer that is not at all a matter of ‘‘convention.’’ That is why I say that this sort of example does not support radical cultural relativism. Our concepts may be culturally relative, but it does not follow that the truth or falsity of everything we say using those concepts is simply ‘‘decided’’ by the culture. (p. 174) Putnam’s quotation brings to the fore two differences between constituting concepts and statements in which constituting concepts are used. First, the quotation shows that ‘‘truth’’ is a qualification that does not apply to constituting concepts, but may apply to statements in which the constituting concepts are used. Researchers can choose how they use the constituting con- cept object (type object or token object), with one choice being no less true than the other, although it can be less or more conventional. In contrast, the qualification ‘‘truth’’ can be applied to the statementThis world contains six objects, and the result depends on the research- er’s definition of the term object (true for token objects, false for type objects). Second, and related, Putnam’s quotation shows that while constituting concepts are intersub- jective in the sense of sharable, statements in which these constituting concepts are used contain an element of objectivity. Researchers do not have the freedom to define the truth of a statement separate from their definition of its constituting concepts. When a researcher has chosen to inter- pret object in the example world as ‘‘token object,’’ then he or she cann", "source": "schoonenboom-2017-a-performative-paradigm-for-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 311, "text": "tuting concepts are intersub- jective in the sense of sharable, statements in which these constituting concepts are used contain an element of objectivity. Researchers do not have the freedom to define the truth of a statement separate from their definition of its constituting concepts. When a researcher has chosen to inter- pret object in the example world as ‘‘token object,’’ then he or she cannot define the number of objects separate from this choice (as, e.g., three). Given a definition ofobject as ‘‘token objec- t,’’it follows that the number of objects in this world is six. The true statementThe number of objects in this world is six, when referring to token objects, is in a specific sense objectively true. Putnam, thus, introduces a concept of truth that does not depend on an independent reality out there, but on a clear explanation of what the constituting concepts mean in utterances that are considered true or false. As a consequence, truth is bound to a specific, historical context. Putnam’s example can be viewed as an investigation into a very simple world with inhabi- tants A, B, C, A, C, and C, where the right answer is immediately clear once the researcher defines the terms object and exist. In contrast, scientific research investigates very complex worlds, based on concepts that interact with each other in endlessly complex ways. In such com- plex worlds, answers to research questions cannot be easily derived directly from a definition of 290 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 13(3) its constituting concepts and data about the world’s inhabitants. Instead, scientific research uses very divergent and often complex research methods from which researchers candiscover prop- erties of these worlds that were previously unknown. Thus, while researchersdefine their worlds by their constituting concepts, they thendiscover these worlds’ often hidden properties. The foundational elements of the performativeparadigm can be explained using the example of neural networks. The advent of the computer enabled the development of neural networks, which consist of simple nodes that can be either on oroff and which are connected to each other through adaptable weights. A network can be given an input pattern and a corresponding output pattern.

Neural networks are so complex that researchers cannot directly and easily answer questions about their characteristics and output patterns based on their constituting concepts and algorithms. Only through scientific inquiry can researchers discover specific characteristics of specific types of neural networks. In neural network inquiry, simulations play an important role. This neural network example speaks to the fact that constituting concepts can emerge, be discovered, or be developed at a specific moment in history. In addition, it shows that, in using these concepts, worlds can becreated, in this case neural networks. It shows that characteristics of specific neural networks cannot be defined separate from anything else, but rather follow from their constituting concepts. Finally, the example shows that to discover the characteristics of neural networks, complex scientific research is needed, in this case research that makes use of complex simulations. The characteristics of worlds that result from scientific research are not eternally valid and may change when these worlds or their constituting concepts change. However, based on both a definition of what the constituting concepts mean and an understanding of how researchers can investigate the interactions between these concepts, the discovered properties of a world can be considered objectively valid for those who accept the definitions of the constituting con- cepts as well as the method of investigation. Because concepts and methods may vary from place to place and change over time, objectivity is always bound to a certain time and context.

How the Performative Research Process Leads to Objectivity Striving for objectivity is an integral goal of the performative paradigm. Before the role of objectivity is defined and explained, the question is raised how objectivity is obtained within the performative paradigm. The question is how objectivity can be obtained if not via a reality check (critical realism), an intersubjective understanding (constructivism), or through the revi- sion of researchers’ beliefs and solving problems (pragmatism). The answer to this question is provided by Pickering’s performative view of research (Pickering, 1995). Pickering (1995) describes the conduct of research as adance of agency, which is characterized by an alternation of actions performed by the researcher and actions performed by the world created by the researcher. To continue this metaphor of the dance, each movement within a dance of agency is characterized by threesteps. In each step, as in a real dance, either the researcher takes the lead, and the world follows, or the world takes the lead and the researcher follows. In those steps in which the researcher takes the lead, the researcher is active, and imposes something on the world. In those steps in which the researcher follows, the researcher steps back and observes how the world reacts to what had been imposed. In the first step, the researcher takes an active role. The researcher starts with particular con- cepts that he or she uses to create a particular world, as well as with particular ideas about how these concepts interact in the created world. Pickering refers to this process asgoal settingand modeling: The researcher’s ideas are imposed on the world. In the second step, the researcher Schoonenboom 291 takes a passive role. By observing the outcomes of imposing his or her ideas on the world, the researcher learns whether his or her ideas about the interactions between the concepts are correct or should be revised. Pickering refers to this as theresistance of material agency. In the third step, the researcher again assumes an active role.

Pickering calls this theaccommo- dation of human agency. The feedback cycle as a whole is called amangle of practice, because it ‘‘mangles’’ the researcher’s ideas. Subsequently, a new feedback cycle starts, and alternating cycles continue until what Pickering refers to asinteractive stabilizationis reached. The dance of agency depicts objectivity as emergent, ‘‘posthuman,’’ and the result of a feed- back dialogue. In Pickering’s (1995) words, the detachment from the intentional structure of human agency through encounters with material and disciplinary agency (themselves proper to no individual subject) is the basis sense of the objec- tivity of science that the mangle makes available to us. (p. 195) These characteristics of Pickering’s approach can be demonstrated using a real-life example from mixed methods research in education (Glewwe, Kremer, & Moulin, 2009). Education has a significant impact on people’s well-being and income. In many developing countries, how- ever, education suffers from a lack of adequate organization and resources. Thus, educational economists have inquired as to what measures are most effective and cost-efficient to improve education in developing countries. In this regard, there is a large consensus among economists that providing textbooks to schools where they are scarce can substantially increase test scores. When Glewwe et al. (2009) began their inquiry into the effect of providing textbooks to pri- mary school children in rural Kenya, they did so with the belief that providing textbooks would positively affect students’ quantitative test scores. However, their intervention study, wherein schools were randomized to treatment, did not find the expected effect. Their follow-up qualita- tive inquiry in the schools, in which children were asked to read the textbooks, revealed that the majority of the children were unable to read these difficult textbooks, which were written in English (not their first language).

Their subsequent quantitative subgroup analysis showed that the textbooks had an effect for excellent students, who were able to read their textbooks. Table 1 displays the subsequent research stages of the Glewwe et al. (2009) example. The models involved are relatively simple and consist of hypotheses. Each research stage starts with an initial hypothesis (Column 1). This hypothesis is then put through a mangle (Column 2), in the example consisting of a qualitative or a quantitative analysis of empirical data. While all other columns refer to the actions of the researcher, Column 3 shows what the material world of a specific mangle tells the researcher. Based on the resistance of this world to the model, the researchers accommodate their hypothesis accordingly (Column 4). Note that the analysis of qualitative observations has bearing on two different hypotheses, shown as separate rows in Table 1. First, the analysis of the qualitative observations provides an explanation for the no- effect finding that resulted from the quantitative overall analysis. Second, the analysis of the qualitative observations makes one of the assumptions of the first hypothesis explicit, namely that providing textbooks can only have an effect for children who are able to read these books. This assumption is then used to differentiate the first hypothesis into separate hypotheses for children who can read their textbook and children who cannot read their textbook. This performative research procedure has much in common with the pragmatist research procedure. However, the focuses of the two are different. Pragmatism assumes that what one finds in reality doesnot necessarily correspond to one’s prior beliefs, while the performative paradigm emphasizes the creation of a new world by the researcher with as-yet-unknown 292 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 13(3) Table 1.

A pragmatist approach is characterized by an alternation between a researcher’s beliefs and his or her actions. The performative paradigm is characterized by an alternation between the researcher and the world created by the researcher, the properties of which by far surpass that which the researcher may have been able to imagine in advance. Objectivity according to Pickering (1995) originates from the feedback that a researcher receives from the world concerning the interactions between the constituting concepts and from the subsequent accommodations of the researcher’s ideas about these interactions. The more cycles of feedback that have been completed, the more objective the result. Objectivity is always a matter of degree and therefore complete objectivity cannot be achieved. This is not so, as in critical realism, because the world cannot be known objectively, but rather because every world is temporary and always ‘‘open’’ to some degree, and because it is always possible for researchers to develop a new test of objectivity. In the performative paradigm, objectivity may also vanish. When the constituting concepts of a world change, the world itself changes, potentially up to a point where it becomes unrecog- nizable. Because of this change in constituting concepts, statements referring to these concepts may no longer be true, as Putnam’s example has demonstrated. As objectivity is a matter of degree and originates from the relationship between a researcher and his or her created worlds, objectivity can and does already arise in a situation that involves only one researcher. Acceptance by peer researchers, although it contributes to objectivity, is not required to obtain a first stage of objectivity. For example, when the categories derived in a grounded theory analysis prove not to fit the data and the researcher consequently adapts the categories, the revised categories can be said to be more objective than the originally derived categories. That is, the categories have passed their first reality test; they have survived their first mangle of practice.

That is, the categories have passed their first reality test; they have survived their first mangle of practice. A Performative Paradigm for Mixed Methods Research The performative paradigm is based on Pickering’s view of objectivity as temporary, emergent, ‘‘posthuman,’’ and the result of a feedback dialogue. Striving for objectivity is seen as one main reason for conducting research. Interaction with differences, important in the dialectic stance (Greene, 2007; Johnson, 2017), is what happens in the mangles of practice. The mangle of practice, thus, can provide a foundation for mixed methods research. Mangles can be of different natures and this includes qualitative and quantitative natures. For example, qualitative grounded theory is a mangle, but so is a quantitative statistical test or a peer review. The more mangles a researcher applies, and the more varied these mangles are, the more objec- tive the result becomes. A higher degree of objectivity can be obtained through mixed methods research in two ways. First, researchers may obtain an ever-increasing degree of objectivity by subsequently applying additional and different mangles to the results of previous mangles. This is the well-knownsequential design (Schoonenboom & Johnson, 2017), in which data collec- tion and data analysis of one method take place after data collection and data analysis of the other method (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). Second, a conclusion will be more objective when it is the result of applying two different mangles at the same time (e.g., applying two dif- ferent research methods to answer the same research question), which is known as aconcurrent design (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). In the performative paradigm, rather than being able to switch between different ontologies and epistemologies, a mixed methods researcher is described as someone who accepts different kinds of objectivity as legitimate and who accepts that different methods may be used to obtain a higher degree of objectivity.

In practice, however, one reason why some quantitative and qua- litative researchers do not perform mixed methods research is that they reject the other 294 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 13(3) approach. I believe that such rejections are more related to a researcher’s understanding of the results obtained using the other approach than to a researcher’s understanding of reality. I believe that a quantitative researcher’s rejection of qualitative research results often does not stem from a rejection of the idea of multiple realities, but rather from the belief that the results of qualitative research are not objective (e.g., because the sample was not representative or large enough to generalize results to a different population). While these objections are war- ranted for quantitative research, they do not apply to qualitative research, which aims at under- standing rather than at generalization. A good mixed methods researcher is someone who accepts that quantitative (i.e., generalization) and qualitative aims (i.e., understanding) are both legitimate aims for research, and that both quantitative and qualitative research can lead to a higher degree of objectivity. A summary of all four paradigms (i.e., the dialectic stance, critical realism, pragmatism, and the performative paradigm) can be found in Table 2. Discussion In this article, I have presented a performative paradigm for mixed methods research. The ontology and epistemology of the performative paradigm stem from dialectical pluralism (Johnson, 2017), which holds that multiple realities can be known in various ways. In addi- tion, realities in the form of worlds are temporary and emergent (Pickering, 1995). In perfor- mative research inquiry, a researcher is viewed as someone who creates new, unknown worlds, which are then subjected to further investigation. Across and within research inqui- ries, an ever-higher degree of objectivity isobtained in successive ‘‘mangles,’’ rounds of feedback, in which the researcher listens to the created world’s feedback and adapts his or her research models accordingly.

Across and within research inqui- ries, an ever-higher degree of objectivity isobtained in successive ‘‘mangles,’’ rounds of feedback, in which the researcher listens to the created world’s feedback and adapts his or her research models accordingly. This objectivity, however, comes to an end when the con- stituting concepts of a given world change. This leads to a change of the entire world and affects the truth of statements about the world, as Putnam’s example has shown. Research involves a succession of multiple mangles. These mangles can be of different kinds, which allows room for both quantitative and qualitative inquiry. Comparing a researcher’s cate- gories to what interviewees have said and his or her subsequent accommodation of these categories (such as in grounded theory) is as much a process of resistance and accommoda- tion as is utilizing quantitative data to test astatistical model. A mixed methods researcher is someone who recognizes both forms of mangling as legitimate. In the performative paradigm, research is viewed as a dialogue: a dialogue between the researcher, the material world, and the social world. The question arises, what role dialogue plays in the other three paradigm, and how this role differs between paradigms. Answering this question reveals the opportunities and at the same time the limitations of the performative para- digm. The dialectic stance emphasizes dialogue among researchers with different worldviews or mental models. This includes dialogue between researchers who hold that there is one reality and researchers who hold that there are multiple realities. This last type of dialogue, unlike oth- ers, is not accommodated within the performative paradigm, which assumes that there are mul- tiple realities, and thus does not provide room for the idea that there is only one reality. While this last type of dialogue is clearly not impossible, this is a limitation of the performative para- digm. Thus, while a mixing of paradigms in the sense of worldviews (Greene, 2007) is not impossible within the performative paradigm, there are some restrictions. Within critical realism, there is a dialogue between researcher and reality.

The performative paradigm recognizes all three elements but deemphasizes the role of the temporary problem. It is not denied that a wish to solve a particular problem may provide a good reason for conducting research. However, once researchers enter into their created worlds and start to interact with them, they may discover issues that are unrelated to their original problem. Therefore, the extent to which the temporary problem is solved is not a criterion for good research or for objectivity in the performative para- digm. Again, this is a limitation of the performative paradigm. This article has methodological significance, as it demonstrates the importance of reflecting on common images from everyday research practice that have an intuitive appeal (Campbell, 1978; Wittgenstein, 1953). In this article, the following four images of research practice have been used to criticize existing paradigms and develop the performative paradigm: 1. Mixed methods researchers do not experience a continual switch between different ontologies and epistemologies (Bryman, 2007). 2. During an inquiry, researchers do not switch between deep-rooted stances about reality (Lincoln, 2010). 3. People partly live in different worlds rather than having different views on one and the same reality. 4. As a researcher applies his or her research models to reality, reality talks back. The first two images show that any paradigm that presupposes that researchers switch between different ontologies and epistemologies during the conduct of research has a problem. Researcher do not experience such a switch (Image 1), and it is unlikely that they switch, because ontologies and epistemologies are deep-rooted stances that do not change easily (Image 2). Hence, the dialectic-stance paradigm, which assumes such a switch, has a fundamen- tal problem. The third image shows that any paradigm that does not include the concept of mul- tiple worlds has a problem. It makes sense to say, and it is a recognized stance in the literature on qualitative research, that people to a certain extent live in different worlds (Image 3).

It makes sense to say, and it is a recognized stance in the literature on qualitative research, that people to a certain extent live in different worlds (Image 3). Hence, the critical realist paradigm has a fundamental problem, because it assumes the existence of one objective world. The fourth image shows that a paradigm ideally should give agency to the material world. Researchers experience that reality talks back (Image 4). The performative paradigm honors this experience by including feedback given by the world as an element of the research dance of agency. One aim of this article was to show that it makes sense to take these four images seriously and give them a proper place in the foundations of mixed methods research. Only when this is done, the mixed methods community is able to overcome confused ideas such as switching between distinct ontologies and epistemologies, or the existence of an objective world that is unable to guide research, and replace them with the more plausible image of a researcher who creates multiple research worlds, interrogates them, and listens to them.

This article comparatively analyzes four major paradigmatic perspectives discussed in mixed methods literature: pragmatism, transformative-emancipation, dialectics, and critical realism. It offers a discussion of each perspective’s implications for mixed methods and how they can be used to influence research based on recent publications. While there are several similarities, such as emphasizing divergent results and allowing for researcher choice in methods, each per- spective offers a unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Emphasizing how paradigms can be used then promotes more explicit engagement with them in future research. Keywords paradigms, mixed methods research, guidelines Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003) identified the ‘‘paradigmatic foundations’’ (p. 4) as a current major issue for mixed methods research. This issue is critical in terms of how to conceptualize, address, and/or move beyond the former ‘‘paradigm wars’’ that have characterized social sci- ence research for the past several decades. Discussions around the paradigmatic foundations for mixed methods research can be characterized in several ways. First, there has been much dis- cussion on what constitutes a paradigm (Freshwater & Cahill, 2013). How scholars use the term paradigm has changed considerably from the original Kuhnian perspective as ‘‘a way to sum- marize researchers’ beliefs about their efforts to create knowledge’’ (Morgan, 2007, p. 50). Biesta (2010) argues that paradigms should be considered as ‘‘tools’’ useful to the research pro- cess but not intending to be exclusionary. Freshwater and Cahill (2013) argue for conceptualiz- ing paradigms not as static perspectives but as ‘‘constructed entities’’ that are more fluid (see Morgan, 2007). Other researchers have argued that the concept of a paradigm is ‘‘unhelpful’’ (Biesta, 2010) and perhaps should be replaced with ‘‘mental models’’ (Greene & Hall, 2010) or ‘‘", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research (1).pdf"}, {"id": 329, "text": "he research pro- cess but not intending to be exclusionary.

As a result, there seems to be little consistency in what researchers identify as the main paradigms in social science research (cf. Bryman, 2006; Greene & Hall, 2010; Mertens, 2012). I would argue that this discussion seems to echo the ‘‘paradigm wars’’ despite the belief that those wars are now largely in a state of peace (Bryman, 2006). 1University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA Corresponding Author: Peggy Shannon-Baker, University of Cincinnati, PO Box 210002, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0002, USA. Email: shannopy@mail.uc.edu Another issue for the paradigmatic foundations of mixed methods addresses whether one paradigm might be best suited to the field over others, or even if such discussions are fruitful (Mertens, 2012). Other researchers approach the use of paradigms based not on honoring one paradigm as better than another. Instead, these researchers believe that qualitative and quantitative approaches can come together to build on their ‘‘complementary strengths’’ and weaknesses (e.g., Morgan, 2007). Still others take an ‘‘aparadigmatic’’ approach, arguing that paradigms could be important for methodology but should not be used to inform the inquiry process. More recently, scholars have argued that empirical research should include explicit discus- sion about the paradigm(s) used (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). For example, Alise and Teddlie (2010) studied the prevalence rate of mixed methods, type of designs, priority, and paradigm usage among the 600 articles they reviewed across five journals in the following fields: nursing, education, sociology, and psychology. They found that only one article expli- citly stated the paradigm used (pragmatism). Thus, in order to characterize the articles as one of four paradigms identified (Alise and Teddlie used the following paradigms: postpositivism, pragmatism, critical or transformative, or constructivism), the researchers had to infer the para- digm used ba", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research (1).pdf"}, {"id": 330, "text": "ing fields: nursing, education, sociology, and psychology.

It is important to engage in discussions about what characterizes or can be considered a paradigm, as well as their application within mixed methods research specifically. For example, I agree with Greene and Hall (2010) that ‘‘quantitative’’ and ‘‘qualitative’’ should not be used as synonymous with paradigms. These qualifiers are instead more about our approaches to data and methods (Biesta, 2010) rather than signaling a singular worldview. It is also important to debate which paradigmatic approaches relate to mixed methods in general. However, argu- ments on what characterizes a ‘‘paradigm’’ versus an ‘‘approach’’ have led us away from the more important issue of how a researcher can operationalize a paradigm. While we advocate for more researchers to discuss their paradigms in their published work, there is not enough gui- dance, particularly for novice researchers, on specifically how these perspectives can be used. In other words, what are the implications of certain paradigmatic perspectives for mixed meth- ods inquiry? By addressing that question, the purpose of this article is to consider the practical implications of paradigms for mixed methods design, implementation, and reporting. It is important to note then that the focus of this article is not to analyze the representation of paradigms in published articles. Alise and Teddlie (2010) already provide an extensive investi- gation of this issue. Instead, the emphasis here is on offering suggestions for specific ways in which researchers can use their paradigm(s) in actionable ways. These suggestions are based on the characteristics, mechanisms, and special considerations particular to each paradigmatic per- spective discussed. These suggestions should not be considered as an exhaustive list but an offering of areas to consider.

These suggestions are based on the characteristics, mechanisms, and special considerations particular to each paradigmatic per- spective discussed. These suggestions should not be considered as an exhaustive list but an offering of areas to consider. Since there are many conceptualizations of ‘‘paradigm,’’ I will first frame this discussion with how I define it and mixed methods research in general. This foundation is especially important considering that one’s conceptualization of ‘‘paradigm’’ ultimately affects its utility in research. Next, I discuss each paradigm—pragmatism, transformative-emancipation, dialec- tics, and critical realism—while focusing explicitly on the implications that each offers for mixed methods inquiry. I chose these paradigms in particular because these are perspectives typically discussed in mixed methods literature (e.g., Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Freshwater & Cahill, 2013; Hesse-Biber & Johnson, 2013). Then, I discuss examples of how these perspectives can be used intentionally based in part on recently published empirical research. These articles were found using each paradigm name and ‘‘mixed methods’’ as key words in search engines such as Summon and Google Scholar, as 320 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) well as in my search of theJournal of Mixed Methods Researchspecifically. I limited the search of articles to the past 10 years and to those that explicitly discussed the use of a philosophical paradigm. Rather than extrapolating the use of a particular paradigm (cf. Alise & Teddlie, 2010), I was interested in the ways in which researchers explicitly used their paradigmatic foun- dation. Given that this article specifically focuses on the use and implications of paradigms, this discussion will be most helpful for research practitioners as well as methodologists generally interested in this issue. Conceptual Frameworks I view mixed methods research as a type of inquiry that is philosophically grounded where an intentional mixture of both qualitative and quantitative approaches is used in a single research study. This mixture, or the integration of these two approaches, can take place in the philosophi- cal or theoretical framework(s), methods of data collection and analysis, o", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research (1).pdf"}, {"id": 332, "text": "n this issue. Conceptual Frameworks I view mixed methods research as a type of inquiry that is philosophically grounded where an intentional mixture of both qualitative and quantitative approaches is used in a single research study. This mixture, or the integration of these two approaches, can take place in the philosophi- cal or theoretical framework(s), methods of data collection and analysis, overall research design, and/or discussion of research conclusions. The purpose of a mixed methods research is to pro- vide a more complex understanding of a phenomenon that would otherwise not have been acces- sible by using one approach alone (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Morse & Niehaus, 2009). In this article, I conceptualize ‘‘paradigms’’ based on Morgan (2007): ‘‘Systems of beliefs and practices that influence how researchers select both the questions they study and methods that they use to study them’’ (p. 49). Paradigms are not static, unchanging entities that restrict all aspects of the research process. Instead, paradigms can help frame one’s approach to a research problem and offer suggestions for how to address it given certain beliefs about the world. Thus, I see paradigms as a guide that the researcher can use to ground their research. It is important to reiterate here that there is debate among mixed methods researchers on the utility of paradigms for mixed methods research, as was discussed above. Indeed, not all researchers—including those in mixed methods—agree that paradigms are a helpful concept due to their potential to marginalize other beliefs or force researchers to buy into a set of beliefs (Maxwell, 2011). While I do agree with these points, I still argue that the conscious use of para- digms can offer a framework for researchers to help guide their decisions during the inquiry process. Paradigms can help the novice researcher align their choices with their values. They can provide a clear indication to those who would like to align themselves with other research- ers who follow similar beliefs (Johnson, 2011). Also, when a researcher provides information about their beliefs, it gives their audience a better understanding of the potential influences on the research. Therefore, I approach the paradigm issue asking notwhether paradigms are useful but how paradigms can be intentionally used; which paradigm to operationalize then is at the rese", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research (1).pdf"}, {"id": 333, "text": " other research- ers who follow similar beliefs (Johnson, 2011). Also, when a researcher provides information about their beliefs, it gives their audience a better understanding of the potential influences on the research. Therefore, I approach the paradigm issue asking notwhether paradigms are useful but how paradigms can be intentionally used; which paradigm to operationalize then is at the researcher’s discretion. On the wordparadigm, in particular, there is discussion on whether the term itself is helpful as discussed above. While the focus of this article is not on this debate, it is important to note that pragmatism, transformative-emancipation, dialectics, and critical realism have been labelled in a variety of ways in other research (cf. Greene & Hall, 2010; Mertens, 2003; Morgan, 2007). Thus, for consistency, I will refer to them asperspectives. In this article, I focus on four paradigmatic perspectives that have been presented as possible paradigms for mixed methods research (e.g., Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Freshwater & Cahill, 2013; Hesse-Biber & Johnson, 2013). While Creswell and Plano Clark (2011), for exam- ple, would agree with my characterization of these as paradigms, it can be argued whether criti- cal realism is a ‘‘paradigm’’ (and not a theoretical perspective for example) or the extent to its actual use in mixed methods (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011, p. 45). There is also a discussion on the distinction between realism and critical realism (e.g., Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Shannon-Baker 321 Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). However, critical realism does offer particular implications for mixed methods and the research process that are worth discussion here. Dialectics can also be characterized as an approach rather than its own separate paradigmatic perspective. This is because research can use this perspective at various levels including para- digmatic, methodological, and analytical. Still, I categorize it here as another perspective for mixed methods researchers because the values at the core of dialectics—dialogue, recognizing similarities and differences, and divergence—can operate at the paradigmatic level and thereby influence decisions throughout the inquiry. Finally, it is notable that I am not discussing postpositivism. While Alise and Teddlie (2010) discussed the large number of mixed methods studies following this paradigm,", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research (1).pdf"}, {"id": 334, "text": "ed methods researchers because the values at the core of dialectics—dialogue, recognizing similarities and differences, and divergence—can operate at the paradigmatic level and thereby influence decisions throughout the inquiry. Finally, it is notable that I am not discussing postpositivism. While Alise and Teddlie (2010) discussed the large number of mixed methods studies following this paradigm, it is not pre- sented in the mixed methods literature as a paradigm that deserves increasing attention like oth- ers. This is the case perhaps because of its dominance in various fields such as medicine and business. According to Alise and Teddlie (2010), the use of this paradigm is so accepted and inherent to some disciplines, though not necessarily mixed methods research itself, that it does not need to be explicitly mentioned; researchers in those fields would already assume its use. Given this, I have focused my discussion on paradigms that warrant further attention for their unique implications. Four Perspectives for Mixed Methods Research I focus my discussion on these four paradigmatic perspectives: pragmatism, transformative- emancipation, dialectics, and critical realism. These were chosen based on their representation in discussions about paradigms by methodologists in mixed methods as well as their potential implications. In the following subsections, I discuss each in more detail, drawing from both the- oretical and empirical research, with particular attention to the contributions of each to mixed methods inquiry. Table 1 presents in brief the unique implications of each paradigmatic perspective for mixed methods research. It presents general information on: the context that in part drove the need for the perspective, how it has been labelled, the purpose for using the particular perspective, and its characteristics. It then details the ramifications of each perspective related to the use of the- ory, the relationship of the researcher to the research, special considerations in the methods, and how inferences are drawn from the data. I came to these categories by considering the basics of mixed methods inquiry based on my conceptualization above. Also, given the impact on con- structivist thinking on all research paradigms, considering the role/relationship of the researcher to the research is increasingly important.

I came to these categories by considering the basics of mixed methods inquiry based on my conceptualization above. Also, given the impact on con- structivist thinking on all research paradigms, considering the role/relationship of the researcher to the research is increasingly important. Pragmatism Morgan (2007) presents pragmatism as an alternative to positivism and ‘‘metaphysical’’ (based on critical theory, postpositivism, and participatory approaches) thinking. Pragmatism is outcome-oriented and interested in determining the meaning of things (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2006) or focusing on the product of the research (Biesta, 2010). It is character- ized by an emphasis on communication and shared meaning-making in order to create practical solutions to social problems. It places primary importance on the research question (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). Pragmatism is based on the belief that theories can be both contextual and generalizable by analyzing them for ‘‘transferability’’ to another situation. The pragmatic researcher is similarly able to maintain both subjectivity in their own reflections on research and objectivity in data collection and analysis. Importantly, it has been referred to as an ‘‘approach’’ rather than a paradigm (Morgan, 2007). This distinction is important because 322 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) Table 1.

According to Morgan (2007), pragmatism addresses three issues with the metaphysical para- digm: ‘‘how to define paradigms, whether those paradigms were incommensurate, and the extent to which metaphysical assumptions actually guide research in the social sciences’’ (p. 66). He argues that rather than relying on the metaphysical paradigm’s a priori ‘‘limits on communication,’’ pragmatism emphasizes creating ‘‘shared meanings and joint action’’ (p. 67). This emphasis points to the underlying belief in complementarity, that is, qualitative and quan- titative approaches can be combined in order to ‘‘compliment’’ the advantages and disadvan- tages present within each. The impact of this complementarity approach can be clearly seen in Arnon & Reichel’s (2009) discussion of their study using a telephone survey to comparatively analyze perceptions of a ‘‘good teacher’’ across gender and ethnicity among Israeli citizens. They used a concurrent parallel design with a telephone interview that included open-ended qualitative questions and a quantitative survey. These data were then analyzed separately and integrated using two meth- ods: ‘‘cross-validation’’ or triangulation and ‘‘quantizing’’ the qualitative codes for statistical analysis (p. 182).

They used a concurrent parallel design with a telephone interview that included open-ended qualitative questions and a quantitative survey. These data were then analyzed separately and integrated using two meth- ods: ‘‘cross-validation’’ or triangulation and ‘‘quantizing’’ the qualitative codes for statistical analysis (p. 182). Methodologically, the discussion of their research centers on the importance of having this pragmatic, complementary approach to their data since their quantitative and qualitative data seemed inconsistent with one another. In other words, despite having disso- nance at the integration stage, Arnon and Reichel (2009) were able to use their pragmatic per- spective to still emphasize the ‘‘shared meanings’’ created as a result of the integration. This reflects the intersubjectivity that pragmatism offers mixed methods researchers, which empha- sizes disrupting the dichotomy between ‘‘complete objectivity’’ and ‘‘complete subjectivity’’ (Morgan, 2007, p. 71). Similarly, the researchers stated that this complementarity was possible in their own working relationships because they ‘‘could speak a common research language and combine [their] diverse research experience and expertise in a joint project’’ (Arnon & Reichel, 2009, p. 178). Sharp et al. (2012) also discussed the impact of this complementarity in the formation a research team from various disciplines. In their article analyzing the impact of pragmatism on their sam- pling in a multisite case study, Sharp et al. (2012) argued that having such diversity was neces- sary in order to engage in a ‘‘mixed methods way of thinking’’ (Greene, 2007). The pragmatic approach also maintains the ‘‘valuable contributions’’ of the metaphysical paradigm, that is, the importance of epistemology and the centrality of one’s world views for their research (Morgan, 2007). While considering these issues, pragmatism focuses on what things will make a difference, as well as connecting abstract issues on the epistemological level to the methodological level. Arnon and Reichel (2009), for example, sought to engage in con- ceptions of multiculturalism and how identities can affect beliefs. It was toward this purpose that the researchers ‘‘gave priority’’ in their research design ‘‘according to [their] pragmatist approach’’ (p. 178). At this conceptual stage, Arnon and Reichel explicitly ", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research (1).pdf"}, {"id": 339, "text": "t issues on the epistemological level to the methodological level.

It was toward this purpose that the researchers ‘‘gave priority’’ in their research design ‘‘according to [their] pragmatist approach’’ (p. 178). At this conceptual stage, Arnon and Reichel explicitly state that pragma- tism influenced their conceptualizations of ‘‘the nature of the investigated phenomena, and the [writing of] research questions and then considered the appropriate methodological ways of inquiry’’ (p. 178). Finally, pragmatism offers several ways to bridge dichotomies that exist in mixed methods approaches to social science. Biesta (2010) addresses this by arguing that ‘‘knowledge’’ can only provide us information about our actions and their results, not of the ‘‘once-and-for-all truths’’ (p. 96). Instead, pragmatism breaks down the hierarchies between positivist and con- structivist ways of knowing in order to look at what is meaningful from both (Biesta, 2010). Addressing the connections between theory and data, pragmatism uses ‘‘abduction,’’ which ‘‘moves back and forth between induction and deduction—first converting observations into Shannon-Baker 325 theories and then assessing those theories through action’’ (Morgan, 2007, p. 71). An example of a research study that explicitly uses pragmatism’s abduction is by Feilzer (2010). In this arti- cle, she discusses the implications pragmatism had on her research study measuring the impact on the general public of receiving factual information concerning crime via newspapers. According to Feilzer, she ‘‘abductively’’ noticed while analyzing the qualitative data that it ‘‘had qualities of stability and recurrence,’’ which prompted her to transform it into quantitative data (p. 10). She characterized her use of abduction as ‘‘moving back and forth between the data sets,’’ combining it with methods for triangulation (p. 12). Also, pragmatism utilizes transferability to consider the implications of research. Transferability in qualitative research refers to the possible local and external connections that data can reveal about a phenomenon (Jensen, 2008). In other words, transferability allows researchers to ‘‘investigate the factors that affect whether the knowledge we gain can be trans- ferred to oth", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research (1).pdf"}, {"id": 340, "text": "ulation (p. 12). Also, pragmatism utilizes transferability to consider the implications of research. Transferability in qualitative research refers to the possible local and external connections that data can reveal about a phenomenon (Jensen, 2008). In other words, transferability allows researchers to ‘‘investigate the factors that affect whether the knowledge we gain can be trans- ferred to other settings’’ (Morgan, 2007, p. 72). Returning to the example offered by Arnon and Reichel (2009), the authors conclude by pointing out the implications of their methods with feedback for researchers intending to use a similar ‘‘multistrand-conversion-concurrent design,’’ a telephone survey, and/or using a survey instrument with both quantitatively and qua- litatively driven questions (p. 191). They also ask pertinent questions on the implications of their research findings for investigating these culturally laden beliefs about a ‘‘good teacher’’ in other national contexts. Transformative-Emancipation2 Mertens (2003) makes an argument against using a pragmatic approach simply because it is practically based. She raises the question ‘‘practical for whom and to what end?’’ (House & Howe, 1999, as cited in Mertens, 2003, p. 159). In response to this, Mertens (2010) argues for adopting particular goals for research, which can be done by utilizing the transformative- emancipatory perspective. This perspective is characterized by the intentional collaboration with minority and marginalized groups or those whose voice is not typically heard on particular issues. According to Mertens (2010), it has been used in disabilities and deafness communities, work on HIV/AIDS, violence prevention, participation in governing structures, and more. This perspective necessitates attention to power, privilege, and voice throughout the research process (Mertens, 2003). It emphasizes making explicit the researcher’s values, ethics, and paradigm(s) (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Mertens, 2010). This perspective was developed in concert with the increase in national awareness on issues related to race, class, gender, and disabilities. It emphasizes considering who is being left out, what groups are being targeted, and how researchers label/recruit/treat. Chilisa (2005), for example, analyzed research in Botswana on the prevention of HIV/AIDS to uncover how these studies have marginalized Afri", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research (1).pdf"}, {"id": 341, "text": " perspective was developed in concert with the increase in national awareness on issues related to race, class, gender, and disabilities.

Chilisa (2005), for example, analyzed research in Botswana on the prevention of HIV/AIDS to uncover how these studies have marginalized African value systems. I would argue that these issues of power inequities and voice should be paid particular attention in studies that rely on a triangulation rationale for the use of mixed methods. For example, how can inferences from qualitative and quantitative data be triangulated if collected from samples at the top and bottom of a bureau- cracy? Conversely, how might an imbalance in power among sample populations influence using a mixed methods approach to discover ‘‘initiation,’’ or differences or paradoxes (Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989)? Thus, integrating the data or results from two different samples under this perspective could be problematic unless the researcher’s goal is to highlight the divergences that exist between the two groups. Mertens (2003) argues that while an in-depth literature review is an important first step in determining the boundaries of what has been published, this approach to information collecting is limited to only that which has been published. Thus, Mertens argues for building strong 326 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) relationships within the community. To utilize a transformative-emancipatory perspective, the researcher must have a strong understanding of the community, its history (particularly related to research), and be well connected if not integrated within the community. Mixed methods researchers might plan for this kind of relationship building as part of their qualitative stage in a sequential exploratory (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011) design for example. It is important to keep in mind though that for some communities, the use of certain methods that have histori- cally negatively affected the community might cause them to be hesitant or even resistant to the research. This emphasis on being integrated within the community is evident throughout the ‘‘check- list’’ provided by Canales (2013) for transformative mixed methods research done with Mexican Americans.

This emphasis on being integrated within the community is evident throughout the ‘‘check- list’’ provided by Canales (2013) for transformative mixed methods research done with Mexican Americans. This checklist was developed as a frame for other researchers to use in order to ensure that their research embodied high-quality mixed methods, critical and feminist theories, and a transformative-emancipatory perspective. Related to Mertens’s (2007) emphasis on getting information not just from the literature, Canales (2013) lists the following: ‘‘learn about the Mexican American community and its perceptions of the issue or problem under study from Mexican Americans themselves’’ (p. 10, italics added). She also lists that mixed methods researchers develop ‘‘trust’’ and ‘‘rapport’’ with the community (p. 10). Beyond building relationships with communities and viewing them as research ‘‘participants,’’Mertens (2003) states that community people should be actually involved in the research. This can be through question development, determining culturally appropriate meth- ods, effective recruitment, sensitive data collection, and so on. Since the transformative- emancipatory perspective advocates the use of marginalized voices within the research, mixed methods researchers can operationalize this in the use of their qualitative results. For example, a sequential explanatory design could be used to highlight the voices of the participants in terms of how they understand the research phenomenon from their own perspective. This type of design utilizes qualitative data collection after the quantitative strand in order to explain or further understand the quantitative data, among other purposes (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). This emphasis on community involvement is evident in the checklist from Canales (2013), though not explicitly. For example, when Canales described how to relate the ‘‘benefits and credibility’’ of a mixed methods design to the transformative-emancipatory perspective, she argues that researchers should hire members of the community to collect data.

I speculate that empowering the involvement of the local community in something like data collection could assist mixed methods researchers utilizing a concurrent parallel design that requires collection of qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously. According to Canales, this involvement ‘‘benefits the community by providing pay and research training to its members and promotes credibility through collaboration with the community’’ (p. 16). Thus, involving the community in the analytic and integration stages of a mixed methods study could further benefit the com- munity beyond simply the products of the research. Of particular issue to the transformative-emancipatory perspective during data collection is the researcher’s ability to explicate how the research will benefit the community, whether the community will view the findings as credible, the appropriateness of the communication, use of culturally sensitive ways to collect data, and ensuring data are used to positively change the community (Mertens, 2007). Canales’s (2013) checklist in particular addresses issues of cul- tural sensitivity, asking how the research questions are posed, whether the measures used are ‘‘culturally equivalent,’’ and if the research will ‘‘validate the culture of Mexican American female participants’’ (p. 11). In terms of data analysis, reporting, and using results, Mertens (2003) stresses that within this perspective it is important to connect quantitative and qualitative data in analysis, look at subgroups to determine any impacts across diversities, interpret results through a lens focused Shannon-Baker 327 on power dynamics, and ensure results are reported in ways that promote social change. By way of advocating for investigating power dynamics, the transformative-emancipatory perspec- tive provides mixed methods researchers with a potential lens from which to base their integra- tion analysis for example.

I would argue also that data transparency, considered a characteristic of quality mixed methods research (O’Cathain, 2010), after the research study can then assist in maintaining a positive relationship with the community. Overall, within the transformative-emancipatory perspective, it is important to frame all deci- sions, data collection, analysis, and reporting within the social and historical contexts of the community. This means paying particular attention to issues of power, privilege, and voice. As detailed above, this perspective offers mixed methods overarching goals to help guide the entire research process, particular considerations for the use of the qualitative data and results depend- ing on design, and suggestions for the focus of integration analyses. Dialectics Dialectics offers a different approach to the paradigm discussion. Instead of conceptualizing another ‘‘paradigm’’ or perspective entirely, dialectics argues for using two or more paradigms together. According to Greene and Hall (2010), a dialectic perspective brings together two or more paradigms in ‘‘respectful dialogue’’ with one another throughout the research process (p. 124). By doing this, dialectics values each paradigm as a unique perspective of the world (Greene, 2007). The emphasis here is not in actually joining the two, but instead focusing on the tensions and new understandings that arise. Dialectics is used as a perspective to address divergent or dissonant data (Mathison, 1988) uncovered when bringing together paradigms with conflicting ideas (Greene & Caracelli, 1997). Among the perspectives discussed here, dialectics offers the most emphasis on divergence in the data and results. This focus on divergence is reminiscent of Greene’s (2007)‘‘initiation’’ rationale for mixed methods research. In the field of evaluation studies, Johnson and Stefurak (2013) take on the question of what evidence is considered credible from a ‘‘dialectical pluralism’’ perspective. Emphasizing the process-based component of dialectics, Johnson and Stefurak use this perspective to bring together and support cross-perspective research teams.

Emphasizing the process-based component of dialectics, Johnson and Stefurak use this perspective to bring together and support cross-perspective research teams. Like the transformative-emancipatory perspective, dialectics also recognizes the importance of researcher’s values on the research process (Johnson & Stefurak, 2013). It is through this recognition that opposing values are equally important and have something offer that dialectics can bring diverse researcher teams and paradigmatic perspectives together. Johnson and Stefurak (2013) also argue for the collection of evidence to support changes in both top-down and bottom-up models. In other words, not only can dialectics provide a frame- work for bringing together potentially opposing perspectives and data, but it also supports social change. Thus, dialectics offers a framework regarding the handling and analysis of data, relationships among researchers and with participants, and dialogue across paradigmatic per- spectives. It stresses no binaries, equal weight between groups, and no hierarchies (Johnson & Stefurak, 2013), making this an ideal paradigm to consider when placing equal priority among strands in a mixed methods study. Frels, Frels, and Onwuegbuzie (2011) recently argued for the increased use of geographic information systems (GIS) to address the seldom investigated spatial contexts relevant to busi- ness and management. In discussing the possibilities of GIS for these fields, Frels et al. identify ‘‘dialectical pluralism’’ as having the ‘‘greatest potential to use GIS applications to their fullest extent’’ (p. 371). This is due to the perspective’s ability to ‘‘incorporate’’ differing epistemolo- gies present in typical uses of GIS compared to business and management research. 328 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) Greene and Hall (2010) also emphasize maintaining a reflective stance throughout the inquiry in order to ensure that any inferences made are ‘‘warranted’’ and thus not a result of the researcher’s biases (p. 138). These reflections are also important in order to generate deep, rich, and complex insights from the data.

These reflections are also important in order to generate deep, rich, and complex insights from the data. Ultimately, dialectics seeks to ‘‘surface, engage and legiti- mize difference in the social world, toward greater understanding and acceptance of differ- ence’’ (p. 140). This emphasis on reflection makes dialectics useful for mixed methods designs based in grounded theory and keeping research memos in general (Wiener, 2007). In terms of the research process, the dialectic perspective believes that the methods used should depend on the study at hand. The researcher(s) should collect, analyze, and report data in ways that promotes dialogue, particularly between the quantitative and qualitative data sets (Greene & Hall, 2010). For example, mixed methods researchers can use side-by-side compari- sons or comparative data displays that bring together both the qualitative and quantitative strands (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). This incites inferences based on these cross-dialogues including addressing those points that raise tensions, contradictions, and paradoxes. As a result, dialectics offers mixed methods research a perspective that not only recognizes difference and diversity but also emphasizes its importance to the point of placing it at the center of all deci- sions and outputs. This perspective is also a mechanism for mixed methods researchers to com- bine two or more paradigms that might be of relevance to their project (Greene & Hall, 2010). Critical Realism While some disciplines have more readily accepted the complementarity argument for para- digms, in other disciplines the paradigm wars have resulted in further ‘‘fragmentation and polarization,’’ impeding the adoption of perspectives like dialectics (Modell, 2009, p. 208). In response to this polarization, some researchers use a critical realist perspective. Discussed as a ‘‘stance’’ (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010), critical realism 3 utilizes the compatibility thesis of worldviews, supporting the point that quantitative and qualitative research can work together to address the other’s limitations.

Discussed as a ‘‘stance’’ (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010), critical realism 3 utilizes the compatibility thesis of worldviews, supporting the point that quantitative and qualitative research can work together to address the other’s limitations. Embodying a constructivist epistemology, critical realism believes in a world that is constructed through our individual standpoints and perceptions (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). However, this is contextualized within the traditional realist ontology where reality can exist outside of perception (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). Thus, while there may be multiple perspectives on a single event or object (Healy & Perry, 2000), critical realism also recognizes that there are realities that cannot not be known (Guba, 1990). As a result, critical realists believe that theories can only be impartial representations of reality. Still, the goal of critical realist research is to measure and verify underlying structures in reality (Bisman, 2010). Similarly, critical realists also believe that objectivity can only be approxi- mated (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). The implications of critical realism’s ontology are represented throughout the practical use of this perspective. For example, due to this belief, critical realists use theory as helpful in guid- ing the research process, while recognizing that such theories are impartial or otherwise incom- plete views of reality. I believe this manifests in mixed methods research based on the ability to discuss how particular findings might not support existing theories. This is not to underestimate the influence of theory on research but to recognize instead that theories cannot offer an all- encompassing or complete view of a phenomenon. Identified as ‘‘compatible’’ with both quantitative and qualitative research, critical realism emphasizes a particular view of causal relationships. Like dialectics, critical realism emphasizes process and a ‘‘generative’’ view (Clark, MacIntyre, & Cruickshank, 2007) of coming to infer- ences during the integration stage. By emphasizing the process, critical realism offers a recogni- tion of relationships between factors that promotes the investigation of context-based causality.

Shannon-Baker 329 It does this by seeking to ‘‘understand how phenomena are generated—in either physical or social realms—[. . . examining] underlying factors that are or potentially are at play’’ (Clark et al., 2007, p. 524). Therefore, critical realists are interested in ‘‘particular situations and events, rather than addressing only general patterns’’ (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010, p. 156). For example, Clark et al. (2007) use a ‘‘critical realist approach’’ in order to critique other research on programs designed to help ‘‘reduce cardiovascular risks and promote health in people with heart disease’’ (p. 513). They argue that contemporary research is based on an ‘‘impoverished ontology’’ related to positivism that does not take into account the contextual factors that influ- ence the health and outcomes of such programs (Clark et al., 2007, p. 513). In another example of mixed methods research utilizing critical realism’s emphasis on con- texts, Douglas, Gray, and van Teijlingen (2010) used a realist approach in their study evaluating smoking cessation intervention programs. They discuss using this perspective specifically in order to illuminate ‘‘thecontext in which an intervention is implemented; themechanisms of that intervention, as well as its outcomes’’ (p. 2). For this study, in particular, it was important to identify the contexts of successful intervention programs since these contextual factors are intimately connected to the success or failure of an intervention. To address this importance, they used a phased design that first mapped the ‘‘context, components and complexity of emer- gent health promotion interventions’’ (p. 3). These contextual maps could then be used to ground their inferences. Critical realism shares with pragmatism the utilization of abduction when applying theory to the data. For example, Modell (2009) discusses two articles that use a critical realist–like approach to triangulation. (Modell states that they are not arguing that the articles use critical realism.)

Critical realism shares with pragmatism the utilization of abduction when applying theory to the data. For example, Modell (2009) discusses two articles that use a critical realist–like approach to triangulation. (Modell states that they are not arguing that the articles use critical realism.) Both examples used an abduction model to bring together multiple theories in order to ‘‘explain context-specific tendencies’’ (p. 218). This approach was used because, according to Modell, the researchers found that traditional approaches to the data could not explain the find- ings that seemed to contradict existing theories. In this way, critical realism offered an approach to add new ‘‘theoretical insights’’ while still attending to particular contexts vis-a`-vis abduction. While both perspectives use abduction, critical realism in particular emphasizes the theory- generating and generalizability of results as well as their context-based nature. Furthermore, this allows for the continual refinement of theories (Modell, 2009). Critical realism also emphasizes the ‘‘mental,’’‘‘part of reality,’’ or how emotion and mental perspectives are important to the research process (Modell, 2009). Critical realists place high importance on perspectives—that is, taking new perspectives, understanding different view- points, and representing diverse voices. Modell (2009) would argue that these diverse view- points can be seen as ‘‘the starting point for further theorizing’’ (p. 219). In fact, ignoring variations in perspectives would make critical realists, according to Modell, ‘‘highly skeptical’’ since it would likely compromise the overall analysis (p. 219). Critical realism can offer mixed methods a perspective that emphasizes diversity and the relationships among people, events, and ideas. This allows for process-based causal inferences, which are not as possible with other perspectives described here. Finally, critical realism also offers mixed methods researchers a perspective that emphasizes perspective-taking and empow- ering the voices of others while still recognizing that these can only be partial representations of reality (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). These components combined make this paradigmatic perspective particularly useful in evaluation-based research studies.

These components combined make this paradigmatic perspective particularly useful in evaluation-based research studies. Conclusions In this article, I have discussed the history and various conceptualizations of paradigm and the ‘‘paradigm issue’’ for mixed methods research, its importance to mixed methods, and four of 330 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) the ‘‘perspectives’’ or philosophical foundations that have particular implications for mixed methods inquiry. By focusing on how these perspectives—that is, pragmatism, transformative- emancipation, dialectics, and critical realism—influence mixed methods design, theory use, relationships, inferences, and data reporting, this discussion is intended to be practically based for novice mixed methods researchers as well as relevant to those interested in the paradigm issue. Pragmatism offers a strong emphasis on research questions, communication, and shared meaning making. In connecting theory to data, it uses abduction, which has been found to be particularly useful during the integration stage of mixed methods. Pragmatism recommends a balance between subjectivity and objectivity throughout the inquiry. Finally, its emphasis on transferability offers a paradigm that can revise previous or create new disciplinary theories based in particular context but still generalizable to others. The transformative-emancipatory perspective specifically addresses social inequities in order to enact positive social change related to oppression, power, and privilege. In working with marginalized groups, voice and power are particularly important considerations that should be addressed in all stages of the mixed methods design. Theoretical frameworks, methods, and the researcher all must have strong relationships to the communities involved. Emphasizing values, this perspective offers mixed methods inquiry specific value-based goals to be incorporated at all stages. Taking a somewhat different stance compared to the other perspectives, dialectics offers a way to bridge seemingly conflicting ideas, theories, and/or data sets.

In particular, this perspec- tive is interested in investigating the nature of these divergences as well as possible conver- gences. As a result, it can be used as a perspective to help address divergences between data sets after integration. Promoting reflection and dialogue throughout, dialectics also offers diverse research teams a frame within which to work together. Finally, critical realism also bridges divides between quantitative and qualitative approaches but is based specifically in the belief that theories on reality are partial thus emphasizing the importance of diverse viewpoints. This ontology then allows for researchers to legitimately dis- cuss divergences in their findings compared to existing literature. Critical realism can help facil- itate dialogue across differences theoretically. It also encourages including insights that are mentally based, such as collecting perception- and reflection-based data. Its emphasis on rela- tionships is connected to its ability to infer causal relationships that are both contextually based and generalizable to others. This perspective has been particularly used in evaluation studies. Through discussion of examples of recent mixed methods research that explicitly engages each of these perspectives, this article offers insights into particular considerations, mechan- isms, and avenues in which researchers can mobilize these perspectives intentionally in their research. While this discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, it does provide a foundation for considering which perspectives might be relevant to a novice researcher based on her or his beliefs and research focus. In most cases, the strategies for intentionally using these perspec- tives were those addressed in the examples discussed above. In a few cases, I used a side-by-side analysis of the articles with the researchers’ identified paradigmatic perspective to uncover any other influences. Future researchers could use the same approach by asking how a particular decision made during the research inquiry aligns with a specific component of her or his paradigm.

Future researchers could use the same approach by asking how a particular decision made during the research inquiry aligns with a specific component of her or his paradigm. Additionally, reading further examples of empirical research that highlight the use of paradigm(s) will also generate ideas for the researcher’s own study. While examples of this reporting do exist and journals are increasingly asking for such discussions (e.g.,Journal of Mixed Methods Research), these examples are still few and far between. Additionally, while several articles were found that identified using dialectics to help reconcile competing beliefs, Shannon-Baker 331 much of these did not adequately discuss how this was done. It is necessary then that our dis- cussions on paradigms promote such intentional uses of these perspectives. While in this discussion, I did intentionally use the termperspective, I still argue for the importance of conducting paradigmatically grounded mixed methods research. There are strong arguments on how the term or concept ofparadigm has become unhelpful at best. It remains to be decided in the field whether replacingparadigm with another term would be useful or if such debate is pulling discussions away from other important issues. However, we should not argue for a single ‘‘best’’ paradigm (or perspective) for mixed methods research. To do so would perhaps enliven a new kind of paradigm war, placing impor- tance on research that uses said paradigm over others when this kind of exclusionary thinking helped prompt the paradigm war as we have come to know it. Thus, the particular paradigm(s) used should be at the discretion of the researcher(s). We should be less concerned with whether researchers chose the ‘‘best’’ paradigm and more concerned with their legitimation for and operationalization of the one chosen. Does it align with her or his values and the research focus? Are the implications of the paradigm clearly and explicitly discussed? How do her or his infer- ences relate to the discussed paradigm(s)?

In this article, I refer to philosophical paradigms and theoretical frameworks as two distinct entities. A philosophical paradigm as a worldview with certain beliefs about how knowledge is constructed and measureable, what is ethical, and the nature of being. A theoretical framework, on the other hand, serves as an explanation for a phenomenon, a general ‘‘orienting lens’’ for understanding a phenom- enon (Creswell, 2009, p. 62), and provides a hypothesis for what might occur or why. 2. After the initial use of the full ‘‘transformative-emancipatory’’ perspective phrase, Mertens (2007) uses ‘‘transformative’’ to refer to this perspective. I have found that in conversations about the ‘‘trans- formative’’ perspective, it tends to be misconceptualized to mean simply some level of change. This misconceptualization may be a result of shortening the term. Therefore, to emphasize its emancipatory foundation, I use the entire term. 3. Maxwell and Mittapalli (2010) use the termrealism interchangeably withcritical realism.

This article comparatively analyzes four major paradigmatic perspectives discussed in mixed methods literature: pragmatism, transformative-emancipation, dialectics, and critical realism. It offers a discussion of each perspective’s implications for mixed methods and how they can be used to influence research based on recent publications. While there are several similarities, such as emphasizing divergent results and allowing for researcher choice in methods, each per- spective offers a unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Emphasizing how paradigms can be used then promotes more explicit engagement with them in future research. Keywords paradigms, mixed methods research, guidelines Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003) identified the ‘‘paradigmatic foundations’’ (p. 4) as a current major issue for mixed methods research. This issue is critical in terms of how to conceptualize, address, and/or move beyond the former ‘‘paradigm wars’’ that have characterized social sci- ence research for the past several decades. Discussions around the paradigmatic foundations for mixed methods research can be characterized in several ways. First, there has been much dis- cussion on what constitutes a paradigm (Freshwater & Cahill, 2013). How scholars use the term paradigm has changed considerably from the original Kuhnian perspective as ‘‘a way to sum- marize researchers’ beliefs about their efforts to create knowledge’’ (Morgan, 2007, p. 50). Biesta (2010) argues that paradigms should be considered as ‘‘tools’’ useful to the research pro- cess but not intending to be exclusionary. Freshwater and Cahill (2013) argue for conceptualiz- ing paradigms not as static perspectives but as ‘‘constructed entities’’ that are more fluid (see Morgan, 2007). Other researchers have argued that the concept of a paradigm is ‘‘unhelpful’’ (Biesta, 2010) and perhaps should be replaced with ‘‘mental models’’ (Greene & Hall, 2010) or ‘‘", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 359, "text": "he research pro- cess but not intending to be exclusionary.

As a result, there seems to be little consistency in what researchers identify as the main paradigms in social science research (cf. Bryman, 2006; Greene & Hall, 2010; Mertens, 2012). I would argue that this discussion seems to echo the ‘‘paradigm wars’’ despite the belief that those wars are now largely in a state of peace (Bryman, 2006). 1University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA Corresponding Author: Peggy Shannon-Baker, University of Cincinnati, PO Box 210002, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0002, USA. Email: shannopy@mail.uc.edu Another issue for the paradigmatic foundations of mixed methods addresses whether one paradigm might be best suited to the field over others, or even if such discussions are fruitful (Mertens, 2012). Other researchers approach the use of paradigms based not on honoring one paradigm as better than another. Instead, these researchers believe that qualitative and quantitative approaches can come together to build on their ‘‘complementary strengths’’ and weaknesses (e.g., Morgan, 2007). Still others take an ‘‘aparadigmatic’’ approach, arguing that paradigms could be important for methodology but should not be used to inform the inquiry process. More recently, scholars have argued that empirical research should include explicit discus- sion about the paradigm(s) used (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). For example, Alise and Teddlie (2010) studied the prevalence rate of mixed methods, type of designs, priority, and paradigm usage among the 600 articles they reviewed across five journals in the following fields: nursing, education, sociology, and psychology. They found that only one article expli- citly stated the paradigm used (pragmatism). Thus, in order to characterize the articles as one of four paradigms identified (Alise and Teddlie used the following paradigms: postpositivism, pragmatism, critical or transformative, or constructivism), the researchers had to infer the para- digm used ba", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 360, "text": "ing fields: nursing, education, sociology, and psychology.

It is important to engage in discussions about what characterizes or can be considered a paradigm, as well as their application within mixed methods research specifically. For example, I agree with Greene and Hall (2010) that ‘‘quantitative’’ and ‘‘qualitative’’ should not be used as synonymous with paradigms. These qualifiers are instead more about our approaches to data and methods (Biesta, 2010) rather than signaling a singular worldview. It is also important to debate which paradigmatic approaches relate to mixed methods in general. However, argu- ments on what characterizes a ‘‘paradigm’’ versus an ‘‘approach’’ have led us away from the more important issue of how a researcher can operationalize a paradigm. While we advocate for more researchers to discuss their paradigms in their published work, there is not enough gui- dance, particularly for novice researchers, on specifically how these perspectives can be used. In other words, what are the implications of certain paradigmatic perspectives for mixed meth- ods inquiry? By addressing that question, the purpose of this article is to consider the practical implications of paradigms for mixed methods design, implementation, and reporting. It is important to note then that the focus of this article is not to analyze the representation of paradigms in published articles. Alise and Teddlie (2010) already provide an extensive investi- gation of this issue. Instead, the emphasis here is on offering suggestions for specific ways in which researchers can use their paradigm(s) in actionable ways. These suggestions are based on the characteristics, mechanisms, and special considerations particular to each paradigmatic per- spective discussed. These suggestions should not be considered as an exhaustive list but an offering of areas to consider.

These suggestions are based on the characteristics, mechanisms, and special considerations particular to each paradigmatic per- spective discussed. These suggestions should not be considered as an exhaustive list but an offering of areas to consider. Since there are many conceptualizations of ‘‘paradigm,’’ I will first frame this discussion with how I define it and mixed methods research in general. This foundation is especially important considering that one’s conceptualization of ‘‘paradigm’’ ultimately affects its utility in research. Next, I discuss each paradigm—pragmatism, transformative-emancipation, dialec- tics, and critical realism—while focusing explicitly on the implications that each offers for mixed methods inquiry. I chose these paradigms in particular because these are perspectives typically discussed in mixed methods literature (e.g., Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Freshwater & Cahill, 2013; Hesse-Biber & Johnson, 2013). Then, I discuss examples of how these perspectives can be used intentionally based in part on recently published empirical research. These articles were found using each paradigm name and ‘‘mixed methods’’ as key words in search engines such as Summon and Google Scholar, as 320 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) well as in my search of theJournal of Mixed Methods Researchspecifically. I limited the search of articles to the past 10 years and to those that explicitly discussed the use of a philosophical paradigm. Rather than extrapolating the use of a particular paradigm (cf. Alise & Teddlie, 2010), I was interested in the ways in which researchers explicitly used their paradigmatic foun- dation. Given that this article specifically focuses on the use and implications of paradigms, this discussion will be most helpful for research practitioners as well as methodologists generally interested in this issue. Conceptual Frameworks I view mixed methods research as a type of inquiry that is philosophically grounded where an intentional mixture of both qualitative and quantitative approaches is used in a single research study. This mixture, or the integration of these two approaches, can take place in the philosophi- cal or theoretical framework(s), methods of data collection and analysis, o", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 362, "text": "n this issue. Conceptual Frameworks I view mixed methods research as a type of inquiry that is philosophically grounded where an intentional mixture of both qualitative and quantitative approaches is used in a single research study. This mixture, or the integration of these two approaches, can take place in the philosophi- cal or theoretical framework(s), methods of data collection and analysis, overall research design, and/or discussion of research conclusions. The purpose of a mixed methods research is to pro- vide a more complex understanding of a phenomenon that would otherwise not have been acces- sible by using one approach alone (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Morse & Niehaus, 2009). In this article, I conceptualize ‘‘paradigms’’ based on Morgan (2007): ‘‘Systems of beliefs and practices that influence how researchers select both the questions they study and methods that they use to study them’’ (p. 49). Paradigms are not static, unchanging entities that restrict all aspects of the research process. Instead, paradigms can help frame one’s approach to a research problem and offer suggestions for how to address it given certain beliefs about the world. Thus, I see paradigms as a guide that the researcher can use to ground their research. It is important to reiterate here that there is debate among mixed methods researchers on the utility of paradigms for mixed methods research, as was discussed above. Indeed, not all researchers—including those in mixed methods—agree that paradigms are a helpful concept due to their potential to marginalize other beliefs or force researchers to buy into a set of beliefs (Maxwell, 2011). While I do agree with these points, I still argue that the conscious use of para- digms can offer a framework for researchers to help guide their decisions during the inquiry process. Paradigms can help the novice researcher align their choices with their values. They can provide a clear indication to those who would like to align themselves with other research- ers who follow similar beliefs (Johnson, 2011). Also, when a researcher provides information about their beliefs, it gives their audience a better understanding of the potential influences on the research. Therefore, I approach the paradigm issue asking notwhether paradigms are useful but how paradigms can be intentionally used; which paradigm to operationalize then is at the rese", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 363, "text": " other research- ers who follow similar beliefs (Johnson, 2011). Also, when a researcher provides information about their beliefs, it gives their audience a better understanding of the potential influences on the research. Therefore, I approach the paradigm issue asking notwhether paradigms are useful but how paradigms can be intentionally used; which paradigm to operationalize then is at the researcher’s discretion. On the wordparadigm, in particular, there is discussion on whether the term itself is helpful as discussed above. While the focus of this article is not on this debate, it is important to note that pragmatism, transformative-emancipation, dialectics, and critical realism have been labelled in a variety of ways in other research (cf. Greene & Hall, 2010; Mertens, 2003; Morgan, 2007). Thus, for consistency, I will refer to them asperspectives. In this article, I focus on four paradigmatic perspectives that have been presented as possible paradigms for mixed methods research (e.g., Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Freshwater & Cahill, 2013; Hesse-Biber & Johnson, 2013). While Creswell and Plano Clark (2011), for exam- ple, would agree with my characterization of these as paradigms, it can be argued whether criti- cal realism is a ‘‘paradigm’’ (and not a theoretical perspective for example) or the extent to its actual use in mixed methods (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011, p. 45). There is also a discussion on the distinction between realism and critical realism (e.g., Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Shannon-Baker 321 Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). However, critical realism does offer particular implications for mixed methods and the research process that are worth discussion here. Dialectics can also be characterized as an approach rather than its own separate paradigmatic perspective. This is because research can use this perspective at various levels including para- digmatic, methodological, and analytical. Still, I categorize it here as another perspective for mixed methods researchers because the values at the core of dialectics—dialogue, recognizing similarities and differences, and divergence—can operate at the paradigmatic level and thereby influence decisions throughout the inquiry. Finally, it is notable that I am not discussing postpositivism. While Alise and Teddlie (2010) discussed the large number of mixed methods studies following this paradigm,", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 364, "text": "ed methods researchers because the values at the core of dialectics—dialogue, recognizing similarities and differences, and divergence—can operate at the paradigmatic level and thereby influence decisions throughout the inquiry. Finally, it is notable that I am not discussing postpositivism. While Alise and Teddlie (2010) discussed the large number of mixed methods studies following this paradigm, it is not pre- sented in the mixed methods literature as a paradigm that deserves increasing attention like oth- ers. This is the case perhaps because of its dominance in various fields such as medicine and business. According to Alise and Teddlie (2010), the use of this paradigm is so accepted and inherent to some disciplines, though not necessarily mixed methods research itself, that it does not need to be explicitly mentioned; researchers in those fields would already assume its use. Given this, I have focused my discussion on paradigms that warrant further attention for their unique implications. Four Perspectives for Mixed Methods Research I focus my discussion on these four paradigmatic perspectives: pragmatism, transformative- emancipation, dialectics, and critical realism. These were chosen based on their representation in discussions about paradigms by methodologists in mixed methods as well as their potential implications. In the following subsections, I discuss each in more detail, drawing from both the- oretical and empirical research, with particular attention to the contributions of each to mixed methods inquiry. Table 1 presents in brief the unique implications of each paradigmatic perspective for mixed methods research. It presents general information on: the context that in part drove the need for the perspective, how it has been labelled, the purpose for using the particular perspective, and its characteristics. It then details the ramifications of each perspective related to the use of the- ory, the relationship of the researcher to the research, special considerations in the methods, and how inferences are drawn from the data. I came to these categories by considering the basics of mixed methods inquiry based on my conceptualization above. Also, given the impact on con- structivist thinking on all research paradigms, considering the role/relationship of the researcher to the research is increasingly important.

I came to these categories by considering the basics of mixed methods inquiry based on my conceptualization above. Also, given the impact on con- structivist thinking on all research paradigms, considering the role/relationship of the researcher to the research is increasingly important. Pragmatism Morgan (2007) presents pragmatism as an alternative to positivism and ‘‘metaphysical’’ (based on critical theory, postpositivism, and participatory approaches) thinking. Pragmatism is outcome-oriented and interested in determining the meaning of things (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2006) or focusing on the product of the research (Biesta, 2010). It is character- ized by an emphasis on communication and shared meaning-making in order to create practical solutions to social problems. It places primary importance on the research question (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). Pragmatism is based on the belief that theories can be both contextual and generalizable by analyzing them for ‘‘transferability’’ to another situation. The pragmatic researcher is similarly able to maintain both subjectivity in their own reflections on research and objectivity in data collection and analysis. Importantly, it has been referred to as an ‘‘approach’’ rather than a paradigm (Morgan, 2007). This distinction is important because 322 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) Table 1.

According to Morgan (2007), pragmatism addresses three issues with the metaphysical para- digm: ‘‘how to define paradigms, whether those paradigms were incommensurate, and the extent to which metaphysical assumptions actually guide research in the social sciences’’ (p. 66). He argues that rather than relying on the metaphysical paradigm’s a priori ‘‘limits on communication,’’ pragmatism emphasizes creating ‘‘shared meanings and joint action’’ (p. 67). This emphasis points to the underlying belief in complementarity, that is, qualitative and quan- titative approaches can be combined in order to ‘‘compliment’’ the advantages and disadvan- tages present within each. The impact of this complementarity approach can be clearly seen in Arnon & Reichel’s (2009) discussion of their study using a telephone survey to comparatively analyze perceptions of a ‘‘good teacher’’ across gender and ethnicity among Israeli citizens. They used a concurrent parallel design with a telephone interview that included open-ended qualitative questions and a quantitative survey. These data were then analyzed separately and integrated using two meth- ods: ‘‘cross-validation’’ or triangulation and ‘‘quantizing’’ the qualitative codes for statistical analysis (p. 182).

They used a concurrent parallel design with a telephone interview that included open-ended qualitative questions and a quantitative survey. These data were then analyzed separately and integrated using two meth- ods: ‘‘cross-validation’’ or triangulation and ‘‘quantizing’’ the qualitative codes for statistical analysis (p. 182). Methodologically, the discussion of their research centers on the importance of having this pragmatic, complementary approach to their data since their quantitative and qualitative data seemed inconsistent with one another. In other words, despite having disso- nance at the integration stage, Arnon and Reichel (2009) were able to use their pragmatic per- spective to still emphasize the ‘‘shared meanings’’ created as a result of the integration. This reflects the intersubjectivity that pragmatism offers mixed methods researchers, which empha- sizes disrupting the dichotomy between ‘‘complete objectivity’’ and ‘‘complete subjectivity’’ (Morgan, 2007, p. 71). Similarly, the researchers stated that this complementarity was possible in their own working relationships because they ‘‘could speak a common research language and combine [their] diverse research experience and expertise in a joint project’’ (Arnon & Reichel, 2009, p. 178). Sharp et al. (2012) also discussed the impact of this complementarity in the formation a research team from various disciplines. In their article analyzing the impact of pragmatism on their sam- pling in a multisite case study, Sharp et al. (2012) argued that having such diversity was neces- sary in order to engage in a ‘‘mixed methods way of thinking’’ (Greene, 2007). The pragmatic approach also maintains the ‘‘valuable contributions’’ of the metaphysical paradigm, that is, the importance of epistemology and the centrality of one’s world views for their research (Morgan, 2007). While considering these issues, pragmatism focuses on what things will make a difference, as well as connecting abstract issues on the epistemological level to the methodological level. Arnon and Reichel (2009), for example, sought to engage in con- ceptions of multiculturalism and how identities can affect beliefs. It was toward this purpose that the researchers ‘‘gave priority’’ in their research design ‘‘according to [their] pragmatist approach’’ (p. 178). At this conceptual stage, Arnon and Reichel explicitly ", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 369, "text": "t issues on the epistemological level to the methodological level.

It was toward this purpose that the researchers ‘‘gave priority’’ in their research design ‘‘according to [their] pragmatist approach’’ (p. 178). At this conceptual stage, Arnon and Reichel explicitly state that pragma- tism influenced their conceptualizations of ‘‘the nature of the investigated phenomena, and the [writing of] research questions and then considered the appropriate methodological ways of inquiry’’ (p. 178). Finally, pragmatism offers several ways to bridge dichotomies that exist in mixed methods approaches to social science. Biesta (2010) addresses this by arguing that ‘‘knowledge’’ can only provide us information about our actions and their results, not of the ‘‘once-and-for-all truths’’ (p. 96). Instead, pragmatism breaks down the hierarchies between positivist and con- structivist ways of knowing in order to look at what is meaningful from both (Biesta, 2010). Addressing the connections between theory and data, pragmatism uses ‘‘abduction,’’ which ‘‘moves back and forth between induction and deduction—first converting observations into Shannon-Baker 325 theories and then assessing those theories through action’’ (Morgan, 2007, p. 71). An example of a research study that explicitly uses pragmatism’s abduction is by Feilzer (2010). In this arti- cle, she discusses the implications pragmatism had on her research study measuring the impact on the general public of receiving factual information concerning crime via newspapers. According to Feilzer, she ‘‘abductively’’ noticed while analyzing the qualitative data that it ‘‘had qualities of stability and recurrence,’’ which prompted her to transform it into quantitative data (p. 10). She characterized her use of abduction as ‘‘moving back and forth between the data sets,’’ combining it with methods for triangulation (p. 12). Also, pragmatism utilizes transferability to consider the implications of research. Transferability in qualitative research refers to the possible local and external connections that data can reveal about a phenomenon (Jensen, 2008). In other words, transferability allows researchers to ‘‘investigate the factors that affect whether the knowledge we gain can be trans- ferred to oth", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 370, "text": "ulation (p. 12).

Transferability in qualitative research refers to the possible local and external connections that data can reveal about a phenomenon (Jensen, 2008). In other words, transferability allows researchers to ‘‘investigate the factors that affect whether the knowledge we gain can be trans- ferred to other settings’’ (Morgan, 2007, p. 72). Returning to the example offered by Arnon and Reichel (2009), the authors conclude by pointing out the implications of their methods with feedback for researchers intending to use a similar ‘‘multistrand-conversion-concurrent design,’’ a telephone survey, and/or using a survey instrument with both quantitatively and qua- litatively driven questions (p. 191). They also ask pertinent questions on the implications of their research findings for investigating these culturally laden beliefs about a ‘‘good teacher’’ in other national contexts. Transformative-Emancipation2 Mertens (2003) makes an argument against using a pragmatic approach simply because it is practically based. She raises the question ‘‘practical for whom and to what end?’’ (House & Howe, 1999, as cited in Mertens, 2003, p. 159). In response to this, Mertens (2010) argues for adopting particular goals for research, which can be done by utilizing the transformative- emancipatory perspective. This perspective is characterized by the intentional collaboration with minority and marginalized groups or those whose voice is not typically heard on particular issues. According to Mertens (2010), it has been used in disabilities and deafness communities, work on HIV/AIDS, violence prevention, participation in governing structures, and more. This perspective necessitates attention to power, privilege, and voice throughout the research process (Mertens, 2003). It emphasizes making explicit the researcher’s values, ethics, and paradigm(s) (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Mertens, 2010). This perspective was developed in concert with the increase in national awareness on issues related to race, class, gender, and disabilities. It emphasizes considering who is being left out, what groups are being targeted, and how researchers label/recruit/treat.

Chilisa (2005), for example, analyzed research in Botswana on the prevention of HIV/AIDS to uncover how these studies have marginalized African value systems. I would argue that these issues of power inequities and voice should be paid particular attention in studies that rely on a triangulation rationale for the use of mixed methods. For example, how can inferences from qualitative and quantitative data be triangulated if collected from samples at the top and bottom of a bureau- cracy? Conversely, how might an imbalance in power among sample populations influence using a mixed methods approach to discover ‘‘initiation,’’ or differences or paradoxes (Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989)? Thus, integrating the data or results from two different samples under this perspective could be problematic unless the researcher’s goal is to highlight the divergences that exist between the two groups. Mertens (2003) argues that while an in-depth literature review is an important first step in determining the boundaries of what has been published, this approach to information collecting is limited to only that which has been published. Thus, Mertens argues for building strong 326 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) relationships within the community. To utilize a transformative-emancipatory perspective, the researcher must have a strong understanding of the community, its history (particularly related to research), and be well connected if not integrated within the community. Mixed methods researchers might plan for this kind of relationship building as part of their qualitative stage in a sequential exploratory (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011) design for example. It is important to keep in mind though that for some communities, the use of certain methods that have histori- cally negatively affected the community might cause them to be hesitant or even resistant to the research. This emphasis on being integrated within the community is evident throughout the ‘‘check- list’’ provided by Canales (2013) for transformative mixed methods research done with Mexican Americans.

This emphasis on being integrated within the community is evident throughout the ‘‘check- list’’ provided by Canales (2013) for transformative mixed methods research done with Mexican Americans. This checklist was developed as a frame for other researchers to use in order to ensure that their research embodied high-quality mixed methods, critical and feminist theories, and a transformative-emancipatory perspective. Related to Mertens’s (2007) emphasis on getting information not just from the literature, Canales (2013) lists the following: ‘‘learn about the Mexican American community and its perceptions of the issue or problem under study from Mexican Americans themselves’’ (p. 10, italics added). She also lists that mixed methods researchers develop ‘‘trust’’ and ‘‘rapport’’ with the community (p. 10). Beyond building relationships with communities and viewing them as research ‘‘participants,’’Mertens (2003) states that community people should be actually involved in the research. This can be through question development, determining culturally appropriate meth- ods, effective recruitment, sensitive data collection, and so on. Since the transformative- emancipatory perspective advocates the use of marginalized voices within the research, mixed methods researchers can operationalize this in the use of their qualitative results. For example, a sequential explanatory design could be used to highlight the voices of the participants in terms of how they understand the research phenomenon from their own perspective. This type of design utilizes qualitative data collection after the quantitative strand in order to explain or further understand the quantitative data, among other purposes (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). This emphasis on community involvement is evident in the checklist from Canales (2013), though not explicitly. For example, when Canales described how to relate the ‘‘benefits and credibility’’ of a mixed methods design to the transformative-emancipatory perspective, she argues that researchers should hire members of the community to collect data. I speculate that empowering the involvement of the local community in something like data collection could assist mixed methods researchers utilizing a", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 373, "text": "plicitly. For example, when Canales described how to relate the ‘‘benefits and credibility’’ of a mixed methods design to the transformative-emancipatory perspective, she argues that researchers should hire members of the community to collect data. I speculate that empowering the involvement of the local community in something like data collection could assist mixed methods researchers utilizing a concurrent parallel design that requires collection of qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously. According to Canales, this involvement ‘‘benefits the community by providing pay and research training to its members and promotes credibility through collaboration with the community’’ (p. 16). Thus, involving the community in the analytic and integration stages of a mixed methods study could further benefit the com- munity beyond simply the products of the research. Of particular issue to the transformative-emancipatory perspective during data collection is the researcher’s ability to explicate how the research will benefit the community, whether the community will view the findings as credible, the appropriateness of the communication, use of culturally sensitive ways to collect data, and ensuring data are used to positively change the community (Mertens, 2007). Canales’s (2013) checklist in particular addresses issues of cul- tural sensitivity, asking how the research questions are posed, whether the measures used are ‘‘culturally equivalent,’’ and if the research will ‘‘validate the culture of Mexican American female participants’’ (p. 11). In terms of data analysis, reporting, and using results, Mertens (2003) stresses that within this perspective it is important to connect quantitative and qualitative data in analysis, look at subgroups to determine any impacts across diversities, interpret results through a lens focused Shannon-Baker 327 on power dynamics, and ensure results are reported in ways that promote social change. By way of advocating for investigating power dynamics, the transformative-emancipatory perspec- tive provides mixed methods researchers with a potential lens from which to base their integra- tion analysis for example.

I would argue also that data transparency, considered a characteristic of quality mixed methods research (O’Cathain, 2010), after the research study can then assist in maintaining a positive relationship with the community. Overall, within the transformative-emancipatory perspective, it is important to frame all deci- sions, data collection, analysis, and reporting within the social and historical contexts of the community. This means paying particular attention to issues of power, privilege, and voice. As detailed above, this perspective offers mixed methods overarching goals to help guide the entire research process, particular considerations for the use of the qualitative data and results depend- ing on design, and suggestions for the focus of integration analyses. Dialectics Dialectics offers a different approach to the paradigm discussion. Instead of conceptualizing another ‘‘paradigm’’ or perspective entirely, dialectics argues for using two or more paradigms together. According to Greene and Hall (2010), a dialectic perspective brings together two or more paradigms in ‘‘respectful dialogue’’ with one another throughout the research process (p. 124). By doing this, dialectics values each paradigm as a unique perspective of the world (Greene, 2007). The emphasis here is not in actually joining the two, but instead focusing on the tensions and new understandings that arise. Dialectics is used as a perspective to address divergent or dissonant data (Mathison, 1988) uncovered when bringing together paradigms with conflicting ideas (Greene & Caracelli, 1997). Among the perspectives discussed here, dialectics offers the most emphasis on divergence in the data and results. This focus on divergence is reminiscent of Greene’s (2007)‘‘initiation’’ rationale for mixed methods research. In the field of evaluation studies, Johnson and Stefurak (2013) take on the question of what evidence is considered credible from a ‘‘dialectical pluralism’’ perspective. Emphasizing the process-based component of dialectics, Johnson and Stefurak use this perspective to bring together and support cross-perspective research teams.

Emphasizing the process-based component of dialectics, Johnson and Stefurak use this perspective to bring together and support cross-perspective research teams. Like the transformative-emancipatory perspective, dialectics also recognizes the importance of researcher’s values on the research process (Johnson & Stefurak, 2013). It is through this recognition that opposing values are equally important and have something offer that dialectics can bring diverse researcher teams and paradigmatic perspectives together. Johnson and Stefurak (2013) also argue for the collection of evidence to support changes in both top-down and bottom-up models. In other words, not only can dialectics provide a frame- work for bringing together potentially opposing perspectives and data, but it also supports social change. Thus, dialectics offers a framework regarding the handling and analysis of data, relationships among researchers and with participants, and dialogue across paradigmatic per- spectives. It stresses no binaries, equal weight between groups, and no hierarchies (Johnson & Stefurak, 2013), making this an ideal paradigm to consider when placing equal priority among strands in a mixed methods study. Frels, Frels, and Onwuegbuzie (2011) recently argued for the increased use of geographic information systems (GIS) to address the seldom investigated spatial contexts relevant to busi- ness and management. In discussing the possibilities of GIS for these fields, Frels et al. identify ‘‘dialectical pluralism’’ as having the ‘‘greatest potential to use GIS applications to their fullest extent’’ (p. 371). This is due to the perspective’s ability to ‘‘incorporate’’ differing epistemolo- gies present in typical uses of GIS compared to business and management research. 328 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) Greene and Hall (2010) also emphasize maintaining a reflective stance throughout the inquiry in order to ensure that any inferences made are ‘‘warranted’’ and thus not a result of the researcher’s biases (p. 138). These reflections are also important in order to generate deep, rich, and complex insights from the data.

These reflections are also important in order to generate deep, rich, and complex insights from the data. Ultimately, dialectics seeks to ‘‘surface, engage and legiti- mize difference in the social world, toward greater understanding and acceptance of differ- ence’’ (p. 140). This emphasis on reflection makes dialectics useful for mixed methods designs based in grounded theory and keeping research memos in general (Wiener, 2007). In terms of the research process, the dialectic perspective believes that the methods used should depend on the study at hand. The researcher(s) should collect, analyze, and report data in ways that promotes dialogue, particularly between the quantitative and qualitative data sets (Greene & Hall, 2010). For example, mixed methods researchers can use side-by-side compari- sons or comparative data displays that bring together both the qualitative and quantitative strands (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). This incites inferences based on these cross-dialogues including addressing those points that raise tensions, contradictions, and paradoxes. As a result, dialectics offers mixed methods research a perspective that not only recognizes difference and diversity but also emphasizes its importance to the point of placing it at the center of all deci- sions and outputs. This perspective is also a mechanism for mixed methods researchers to com- bine two or more paradigms that might be of relevance to their project (Greene & Hall, 2010). Critical Realism While some disciplines have more readily accepted the complementarity argument for para- digms, in other disciplines the paradigm wars have resulted in further ‘‘fragmentation and polarization,’’ impeding the adoption of perspectives like dialectics (Modell, 2009, p. 208). In response to this polarization, some researchers use a critical realist perspective. Discussed as a ‘‘stance’’ (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010), critical realism 3 utilizes the compatibility thesis of worldviews, supporting the point that quantitative and qualitative research can work together to address the other’s limitations.

Discussed as a ‘‘stance’’ (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010), critical realism 3 utilizes the compatibility thesis of worldviews, supporting the point that quantitative and qualitative research can work together to address the other’s limitations. Embodying a constructivist epistemology, critical realism believes in a world that is constructed through our individual standpoints and perceptions (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). However, this is contextualized within the traditional realist ontology where reality can exist outside of perception (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). Thus, while there may be multiple perspectives on a single event or object (Healy & Perry, 2000), critical realism also recognizes that there are realities that cannot not be known (Guba, 1990). As a result, critical realists believe that theories can only be impartial representations of reality. Still, the goal of critical realist research is to measure and verify underlying structures in reality (Bisman, 2010). Similarly, critical realists also believe that objectivity can only be approxi- mated (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). The implications of critical realism’s ontology are represented throughout the practical use of this perspective. For example, due to this belief, critical realists use theory as helpful in guid- ing the research process, while recognizing that such theories are impartial or otherwise incom- plete views of reality. I believe this manifests in mixed methods research based on the ability to discuss how particular findings might not support existing theories. This is not to underestimate the influence of theory on research but to recognize instead that theories cannot offer an all- encompassing or complete view of a phenomenon. Identified as ‘‘compatible’’ with both quantitative and qualitative research, critical realism emphasizes a particular view of causal relationships. Like dialectics, critical realism emphasizes process and a ‘‘generative’’ view (Clark, MacIntyre, & Cruickshank, 2007) of coming to infer- ences during the integration stage. By emphasizing the process, critical realism offers a recogni- tion of relationships between factors that promotes the investigation of context-based causality. Shannon-Baker 329 It does this by seeking to ‘‘understand how phenomena are generated—in either physical or social realms—[. .

Shannon-Baker 329 It does this by seeking to ‘‘understand how phenomena are generated—in either physical or social realms—[. . . examining] underlying factors that are or potentially are at play’’ (Clark et al., 2007, p. 524). Therefore, critical realists are interested in ‘‘particular situations and events, rather than addressing only general patterns’’ (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010, p. 156). For example, Clark et al. (2007) use a ‘‘critical realist approach’’ in order to critique other research on programs designed to help ‘‘reduce cardiovascular risks and promote health in people with heart disease’’ (p. 513). They argue that contemporary research is based on an ‘‘impoverished ontology’’ related to positivism that does not take into account the contextual factors that influ- ence the health and outcomes of such programs (Clark et al., 2007, p. 513). In another example of mixed methods research utilizing critical realism’s emphasis on con- texts, Douglas, Gray, and van Teijlingen (2010) used a realist approach in their study evaluating smoking cessation intervention programs. They discuss using this perspective specifically in order to illuminate ‘‘thecontext in which an intervention is implemented; themechanisms of that intervention, as well as its outcomes’’ (p. 2). For this study, in particular, it was important to identify the contexts of successful intervention programs since these contextual factors are intimately connected to the success or failure of an intervention. To address this importance, they used a phased design that first mapped the ‘‘context, components and complexity of emer- gent health promotion interventions’’ (p. 3). These contextual maps could then be used to ground their inferences. Critical realism shares with pragmatism the utilization of abduction when applying theory to the data. For example, Modell (2009) discusses two articles that use a critical realist–like approach to triangulation. (Modell states that they are not arguing that the articles use critical realism.) Both examples used an abduction model to bring together multiple theories in order to ‘‘explain", "source": "shannon-baker-2015-making-paradigms-meaningful-in-mixed-methods-research.pdf"}, {"id": 379, "text": "ferences. Critical realism shares with pragmatism the utilization of abduction when applying theory to the data. For example, Modell (2009) discusses two articles that use a critical realist–like approach to triangulation. (Modell states that they are not arguing that the articles use critical realism.) Both examples used an abduction model to bring together multiple theories in order to ‘‘explain context-specific tendencies’’ (p. 218). This approach was used because, according to Modell, the researchers found that traditional approaches to the data could not explain the find- ings that seemed to contradict existing theories. In this way, critical realism offered an approach to add new ‘‘theoretical insights’’ while still attending to particular contexts vis-a`-vis abduction. While both perspectives use abduction, critical realism in particular emphasizes the theory- generating and generalizability of results as well as their context-based nature. Furthermore, this allows for the continual refinement of theories (Modell, 2009). Critical realism also emphasizes the ‘‘mental,’’‘‘part of reality,’’ or how emotion and mental perspectives are important to the research process (Modell, 2009). Critical realists place high importance on perspectives—that is, taking new perspectives, understanding different view- points, and representing diverse voices. Modell (2009) would argue that these diverse view- points can be seen as ‘‘the starting point for further theorizing’’ (p. 219). In fact, ignoring variations in perspectives would make critical realists, according to Modell, ‘‘highly skeptical’’ since it would likely compromise the overall analysis (p. 219). Critical realism can offer mixed methods a perspective that emphasizes diversity and the relationships among people, events, and ideas. This allows for process-based causal inferences, which are not as possible with other perspectives described here. Finally, critical realism also offers mixed methods researchers a perspective that emphasizes perspective-taking and empow- ering the voices of others while still recognizing that these can only be partial representations of reality (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). These components combined make this paradigmatic perspective particularly useful in evaluation-based research studies.

These components combined make this paradigmatic perspective particularly useful in evaluation-based research studies. Conclusions In this article, I have discussed the history and various conceptualizations of paradigm and the ‘‘paradigm issue’’ for mixed methods research, its importance to mixed methods, and four of 330 Journal of Mixed Methods Research 10(4) the ‘‘perspectives’’ or philosophical foundations that have particular implications for mixed methods inquiry. By focusing on how these perspectives—that is, pragmatism, transformative- emancipation, dialectics, and critical realism—influence mixed methods design, theory use, relationships, inferences, and data reporting, this discussion is intended to be practically based for novice mixed methods researchers as well as relevant to those interested in the paradigm issue. Pragmatism offers a strong emphasis on research questions, communication, and shared meaning making. In connecting theory to data, it uses abduction, which has been found to be particularly useful during the integration stage of mixed methods. Pragmatism recommends a balance between subjectivity and objectivity throughout the inquiry. Finally, its emphasis on transferability offers a paradigm that can revise previous or create new disciplinary theories based in particular context but still generalizable to others. The transformative-emancipatory perspective specifically addresses social inequities in order to enact positive social change related to oppression, power, and privilege. In working with marginalized groups, voice and power are particularly important considerations that should be addressed in all stages of the mixed methods design. Theoretical frameworks, methods, and the researcher all must have strong relationships to the communities involved. Emphasizing values, this perspective offers mixed methods inquiry specific value-based goals to be incorporated at all stages. Taking a somewhat different stance compared to the other perspectives, dialectics offers a way to bridge seemingly conflicting ideas, theories, and/or data sets.

In particular, this perspec- tive is interested in investigating the nature of these divergences as well as possible conver- gences. As a result, it can be used as a perspective to help address divergences between data sets after integration. Promoting reflection and dialogue throughout, dialectics also offers diverse research teams a frame within which to work together. Finally, critical realism also bridges divides between quantitative and qualitative approaches but is based specifically in the belief that theories on reality are partial thus emphasizing the importance of diverse viewpoints. This ontology then allows for researchers to legitimately dis- cuss divergences in their findings compared to existing literature. Critical realism can help facil- itate dialogue across differences theoretically. It also encourages including insights that are mentally based, such as collecting perception- and reflection-based data. Its emphasis on rela- tionships is connected to its ability to infer causal relationships that are both contextually based and generalizable to others. This perspective has been particularly used in evaluation studies. Through discussion of examples of recent mixed methods research that explicitly engages each of these perspectives, this article offers insights into particular considerations, mechan- isms, and avenues in which researchers can mobilize these perspectives intentionally in their research. While this discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, it does provide a foundation for considering which perspectives might be relevant to a novice researcher based on her or his beliefs and research focus. In most cases, the strategies for intentionally using these perspec- tives were those addressed in the examples discussed above. In a few cases, I used a side-by-side analysis of the articles with the researchers’ identified paradigmatic perspective to uncover any other influences. Future researchers could use the same approach by asking how a particular decision made during the research inquiry aligns with a specific component of her or his paradigm.

Additionally, reading further examples of empirical research that highlight the use of paradigm(s) will also generate ideas for the researcher’s own study. While examples of this reporting do exist and journals are increasingly asking for such discussions (e.g.,Journal of Mixed Methods Research), these examples are still few and far between. Additionally, while several articles were found that identified using dialectics to help reconcile competing beliefs, Shannon-Baker 331 much of these did not adequately discuss how this was done. It is necessary then that our dis- cussions on paradigms promote such intentional uses of these perspectives. While in this discussion, I did intentionally use the termperspective, I still argue for the importance of conducting paradigmatically grounded mixed methods research. There are strong arguments on how the term or concept ofparadigm has become unhelpful at best. It remains to be decided in the field whether replacingparadigm with another term would be useful or if such debate is pulling discussions away from other important issues. However, we should not argue for a single ‘‘best’’ paradigm (or perspective) for mixed methods research. To do so would perhaps enliven a new kind of paradigm war, placing impor- tance on research that uses said paradigm over others when this kind of exclusionary thinking helped prompt the paradigm war as we have come to know it. Thus, the particular paradigm(s) used should be at the discretion of the researcher(s). We should be less concerned with whether researchers chose the ‘‘best’’ paradigm and more concerned with their legitimation for and operationalization of the one chosen. Does it align with her or his values and the research focus? Are the implications of the paradigm clearly and explicitly discussed? How do her or his infer- ences relate to the discussed paradigm(s)?

In this article, I refer to philosophical paradigms and theoretical frameworks as two distinct entities. A philosophical paradigm as a worldview with certain beliefs about how knowledge is constructed and measureable, what is ethical, and the nature of being. A theoretical framework, on the other hand, serves as an explanation for a phenomenon, a general ‘‘orienting lens’’ for understanding a phenom- enon (Creswell, 2009, p. 62), and provides a hypothesis for what might occur or why. 2. After the initial use of the full ‘‘transformative-emancipatory’’ perspective phrase, Mertens (2007) uses ‘‘transformative’’ to refer to this perspective. I have found that in conversations about the ‘‘trans- formative’’ perspective, it tends to be misconceptualized to mean simply some level of change. This misconceptualization may be a result of shortening the term. Therefore, to emphasize its emancipatory foundation, I use the entire term. 3.

Email: ehollin3@uwo.ca 1 | INTRODUCTION Recognising and exploring one’s social identities, personal histories and philosophical assumptions may, at first glance, seem out of place in a research manuscript. However, if such a manuscript is epistemo- logically aligned with qualitative inquiry paradigms, this introspective approach becomes imperative. Positionality, or the‘disciplined view and articulation of one’s analytically situated self’, 1 describes how ‘the researcher enters into the process of knowledge production’.2 Therefore, addressing positionality becomes indispensable for foster- ing transparency and enhancing methodological rigour in qualitative research. It is this deliberate engagement with positionality that enables researchers to enrich scholarly inquiry whilst deepening our understanding of complex phenomena. To that end, we asked Bearman et al., 3 the authors of theTrainees as teachers: Building evaluative judgement through peer teaching(article housed within this edition) why they felt incorporating positionality was important in their work and how they went about doing so. 2 | Q1: 1. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR RESEARCHERS TO ADDRESS POSITIONALITY IN THEIR WORK? Addressing positionality is important for both researchers and their readers because of its influence on the research process and out- comes. For researchers, positionality determines what we value and are interested in, so it underlies our choices of what to study and how to study it. When we engage in research, our answers to such basic questions such as ‘what is data?’, ‘how is it produced?’ and ‘what might it mean?’ reflect our social identities, personal histories and our ontologic and epistemologic assumptions. Our positionality then has a crucial role in our resea", "source": "The Clinical Teacher - 2024 - Kennedy - Addressing positionality in qualitative research  Significance  challenges and.pdf"}, {"id": 389, "text": "rmines what we value and are interested in, so it underlies our choices of what to study and how to study it. When we engage in research, our answers to such basic questions such as ‘what is data?’, ‘how is it produced?’ and ‘what might it mean?’ reflect our social identities, personal histories and our ontologic and epistemologic assumptions. Our positionality then has a crucial role in our research, regardless of whether we address it or not. As Field et al., 4 point out, examining positionality is a pre- requisite for reflexivity. Leaving our positionality unexamined will likely hamper our efforts to justify our research choices and cheapen our analysis and interpretation. For research involving direct interaction and access to a particu- lar community or context such as in this study, our positionality will also impact our relationships with participants and the data pro- duced. Our positionality will influence how we and participants relate to one another, the nature of the access they are willing to provide us to their thoughts or actions or environments and our possible interpretations. The issue of insider/outsider status and hence the role of familiarity and naivete in how we access and inter- pret a participant’s world is a well-known example of this. There are more nuanced impacts as well, such as accounting for researcher privilege, negotiating power relations or respecting the vulnerability of participants in exposing their private thoughts or accounts of experience to public scrutiny. Beyond the research process and its outcome (including down- stream impact), how we see the world and what types of knowledge and methods of knowledge production we value will influence our interaction with our audience. Readers’own positionality will influ- ence how they interpret the work and what value they attach to it. It may be that we are more likely to find an appreciative audience amongst those whose positioning bears at least some similarity to our own.

Since we think incorporating positionality and reflexivity into our man- uscripts is a necessary part of the rigour of our research, we would like to incorporate details of our positionality and how it influenced our work for readers. As Field et al., 4 point out, space constraints influence how we deal with positionality in manuscripts. The dilemma is that an imperfect published paper is infinitely superior to a perfect paper that remains unpublished. As researchers, we are sensitive to the explicit and implicit rules and norms of the conversation we wish to join. Hence, we start by attending to the author guidelines and the style of the papers published in the journal where we think we will reach the desired audience. However, we recognise that these rules and norms are not static but evolve as authors and reviewers/editors negotiate them in practice. We might choose to stretch the boundaries and contribute to this evolution where we have more confidence that our paper will be accepted or that we have alternative journals in mind if the editor and reviewers are not ready for evolution of practices. 4 | Q3: HOW DO YOU LEAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT POSITIONALITY IN YOUR RESEARCH TEAM MEETINGS AS THE RESEARCH LEAD, AND HOW DO YOU FEEL THAT INFLUENCES TEAM DECISIONS? These conversations are foundational to the very commencement of research design. Sometimes, when researching equity, inclusion and diversity, these conversations may lead to inviting new members on to the research team, to expand its diversity, and sometimes an advisory board may be established or enhanced. A deliberate shift to participatory methods is also a matter of positionality: The team is positioned as researching with participants, rather than about them. In our experience, there can be considerable time inves", "source": "The Clinical Teacher - 2024 - Kennedy - Addressing positionality in qualitative research  Significance  challenges and.pdf"}, {"id": 391, "text": "on and diversity, these conversations may lead to inviting new members on to the research team, to expand its diversity, and sometimes an advisory board may be established or enhanced. A deliberate shift to participatory methods is also a matter of positionality: The team is positioned as researching with participants, rather than about them. In our experience, there can be considerable time invested upfront in understanding the positionality of team members in refer- ence to the phenomenon of interest (and not taken for granted that that there is a shared representation or interest in the phenomenon). For example, in a qualitative synthesis paper exploring feedback in higher degree research 3 despite selecting team members that‘may share’ similar views on feedback, we asked all research team members to articulate their positioning (homework) and came together in a face-to-face forum to understand similarities and differences, and how these may bear out on the research question and approach. The questions we asked ourselves are listed below in Table 1: Discussions about positionality tend to be most overt when PhD candidates are embarking on their thesis. There is an expectation that PhD students will be probed with questions such as the following: Why are you interested in this question? What do you take to mean by this concept? How might your own experience influence what you see in the transcripts? However, the positionality of supervisors may be less explicit although of course it is always present. It is not uncommon for research papers that are led by PhD candidates to orientate more strongly to the primary author’s positionality as part of the learning process. 5 | Q4: IN THE MANUSCRIPT, TRAINEES AS TEACHERS: BUILDING EVALUATIVE JUDGEMENT THROUGH PEER TEACHING, POSITIONALITY IS PRESENTED FROM A GROUP PERSPECTIVE RATHER THAN A SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS. WHY DID THE AUTHORS CHOOSE TO PRESENT POSITIONALITY IN THIS WAY? Positionality is itself a matter of positionality! As authors, we tend to view the social world as relational rather than individual— and this aligns with a mix of collective and individual representation of our position’s vis a vis the research. In Field et al.,4 the authors wrote ‘Positionality is dynamic, contextual and informed by broader power relations. One’s positionality can shift over time and place, within an institution an", "source": "The Clinical Teacher - 2024 - Kennedy - Addressing positionality in qualitative research  Significance  challenges and.pdf"}, {"id": 392, "text": "ositionality! As authors, we tend to view the social world as relational rather than individual— and this aligns with a mix of collective and individual representation of our position’s vis a vis the research. In Field et al.,4 the authors wrote ‘Positionality is dynamic, contextual and informed by broader power relations. One’s positionality can shift over time and place, within an institution and in relation to different research projects’. Thus, we propose that (for us) individual statements elide the dynamic engage- ment of how we collectively and individually positioned ourselves with the work at hand. Thus, whilst we described our collective under- standings, we also highlighted some individual variation in our per- sonal histories, circumstances and research experiences. This was a conscious decision to highlight the necessary variation within the team, which will inevitably shape design, analytical processes, and the way in which the data is presented. In short, we do a little bit of both, as we think it reflects the way in which our positions influenced the research: collectively, dynamically and individually. 6 | CONCLUSION In summary, the integration of positionality within research efforts, particularly those aligned with qualitative inquiry paradigms, under- scores a vital dimension often overlooked in traditional scholarly dis- course. 5 Positionality, encapsulating one’s social identities, personal TABLE 1 Positioning prompts on feedback in higher degree research.

Given that the inclusion of positionality often prompts thoughtful consideration of diverse perspectives and methodologies, embracing positionality, whether through individual or collective articulations, underscores the dynamic nature of qualitative research and reaffirms the commitment to reflexivity and intellectual integrity.
