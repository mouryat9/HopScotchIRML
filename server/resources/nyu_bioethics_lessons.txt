KEY ETHICAL PRINCIPLES FOR RESEARCH:
1. Respect for Persons: Protecting individual autonomy and ensuring informed consent
2. Beneficence: Doing no harm while maximizing benefits and minimizing risks
3. Justice: Fair participant recruitment and distribution of research burdens and benefits
4. Informed Consent: Participants must know the study's nature and voluntarily consent
5. IRB Approval: Institutional Review Board oversight to protect human subjects
