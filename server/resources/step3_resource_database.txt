DEFINITIONS AND KEY CONCEPTS
----------------------------------------
Conceptual Framework: A conceptual framework is both a process and a product through which a researcher constructs and presents the “why” of the study — that is, why the topic matters — and links that rationale to the literature, theory, methodology, and the design of the study. It serves as a mechanism for aligning and integrating the literature review, research questions, theoretical or conceptual underpinnings, methods, and analysis of the study

Key Elements (based on Ravitch & Riggan, 2017)

Here are the major elements or functions of a conceptual framework according to their presentation:
-Concepts, assumptions, expectations, beliefs, and theories: The framework makes explicit the researcher’s underlying views about the phenomena under study. -Alignment and coherence: It shows how the study’s literature review, theoretical orientation, research questions, methods, data collection, and analysis are interconnected and coherent. 
-Guide and ballast: The framework acts as both a guide (steering the research) and ballast (providing stability) in the conduct of an empirical study. 
-Processes of development: It’s not only a document or diagram at the start, but a process of continual refinement as the study evolves. 
-Justification of research decisions: The framework assists in justifying why particular research methods, data collection strategies, and analytic approaches were selected over others. 

Literature Review: A literature review is the process and product of reviewing existing scholarship on relevant concepts, phenomena, contexts and studies related to your research topic. In their work, Ravitch & Riggan emphasize that a strong literature review:

-Surveys what has already been written, identifies gaps or tensions in the body of work, and helps frame the importance of the study. 
-Is not simply a descriptive summary but provides a critical, analytical engagement with the literature — showing how prior research shapes your topic and how your study will contribute. 
-Serves as one of the components that feed into a conceptual framework; in particular it helps define the “topical research” component discussed below (i.e., what has been done, and what remains). 
-Helps justify your methodological choices by showing what has worked (or not) in previous work and by situating your research in that scholarly conversation. 

In summary, a literature review is the foundation that situates your study in the existing body of knowledge and creates a rationale for your work.

Topical Research: Within the framework of Ravitch & Riggan, “topical research” refers to the body of work and empirical studies directly relevant to the topic you are studying — essentially the “what” of the study, as opposed to the “why” or “how.” They list “topical research” as one of the three primary elements of a conceptual framework (alongside personal interests and theoretical frameworks). 

Key points about topical research:
-It embodies the empirical investigations, studies, and discussions already conducted in your substantive area (“what others have done”). 
-It helps you identify the constructs, variables, phenomena, or contexts that must be explored or challenged in your research.
-The topical research component supports the argument for the study’s significance: by showing where prior work has focused, where gaps remain, and how your study fits in.
-In their phrasing, Ravitch & Riggan distinguish that topical research “describes the what of the study” while theoretical frameworks clarify the why and how. 

In short: Topical research is the domain of prior empirical or topic‑specific literature that grounds the study’s focus and helps define what is being studied.


Theoretical Frameworks: According to Ravitch & Riggan, the theoretical framework is a subset of the conceptual framework (but a critical one) that brings in formal theories, constructs, assumptions, and models to explain and interpret phenomena. It helps articulate the underpinning reasons and mechanisms — the “why” and “how” of the research. 

Key features of the theoretical framework:
-It comprises linked concepts, assumptions, expectations, beliefs, and existing theories that the researcher uses to frame their study. 
-It guides the research design, informing what you will measure/observe, how you will interpret those observations, and how you will relate them back to theory. 
-It provides the lens through which you view your topic, and thus helps to locate your study within broader theoretical conversations.
-While many authors treat theoretical and conceptual frameworks as interchangeable, Ravitch & Riggan argue that the theoretical framework is embedded within the broader conceptual framework (which also includes personal interests and topical research). 

In short: The theoretical framework is the structured set of theories and constructs that explains how and why the research topic is being approached in a particular way.

SCRAPED WEB CONTENT: Literature Review and Conceptual Framework

From Claremont Colleges Library Guide:
A literature review is a systematic and comprehensive analysis of books, scholarly articles and other sources relevant to a specific topic. Its core purposes are identifying and critiquing existing literature while exposing research gaps.

Six Review Approaches:
- Argumentative: Selectively examines literature to support or refute established arguments
- Integrative: Reviews, critiques, and synthesizes representative literature generating new frameworks
- Historical: Traces issue evolution across time periods
- Methodological: Focuses on how research was conducted, examining analysis frameworks
- Systematic: Uses pre-specified and standardized methods to identify and critically appraise relevant research
- Theoretical: Examines accumulated theory regarding concepts or phenomena

From AP Research Step 3 (Kennesaw State):
Step 3 focuses on reviewing existing knowledge before designing your research study. A literature review serves three critical functions: identifying small gaps in existing knowledge, confirming the viability of a research question, and demonstrating the added value of your work.

Three Strategic Components:
- Position: Selecting a narrow topic and answerable research question
- Justify: Confirming research viability and identifying knowledge gaps
- Frame: Creating a coherent conceptual or theoretical framework
