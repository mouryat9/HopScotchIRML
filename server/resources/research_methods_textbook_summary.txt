CHAPTER 1: THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY
Methods of knowing, understanding science, goals of science, and distinctions between experimental and clinical psychology.

CHAPTER 2: OVERVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
Research topic selection, question generation, hypothesis development, study design, data analysis, and result reporting.

CHAPTER 3: RESEARCH ETHICS
Moral foundations, ethics codes, and practical implementation of ethical standards. Key principles include: respect for persons, beneficence, justice, informed consent, and IRB approval.

CHAPTER 4: PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT
Understanding measurement, reliability, validity, and practical measurement strategies.
- Reliability: The consistency of a measure. Types include test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and internal consistency.
- Validity: The extent to which a measure actually measures what it claims to measure. Types include construct validity, content validity, criterion validity, internal validity, and external validity.

CHAPTER 5: EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
Experiment fundamentals, design approaches, validity considerations, and practical implementation. Experiments involve manipulating an independent variable and measuring its effect on a dependent variable while controlling confounding variables. Random assignment is critical for establishing causal relationships.

CHAPTER 6: NON-EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
Correlational studies examine relationships between variables without manipulation. Qualitative methods include participant observation, case studies, and narrative analysis. Observational techniques involve systematic recording of behavior.

CHAPTER 7: SURVEY RESEARCH
Survey overview, construction methods, and conducting procedures. Surveys can gather data from large samples efficiently but are limited to self-reported data.

CHAPTER 8: QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
One-group designs and non-equivalent control group designs. These resemble experiments but lack random assignment, making causal inference more challenging.

CHAPTER 9: FACTORIAL DESIGNS
Setting up factorial experiments and interpreting results. Factorial designs examine the effects of two or more independent variables simultaneously.

CHAPTER 10: SINGLE-SUBJECT RESEARCH
Overview, specific designs, and group research comparisons. Used when studying individual cases in depth.

CHAPTER 11: PRESENTING YOUR RESEARCH
APA style formatting, research report writing, and alternative presentation formats.

CHAPTER 12: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
- Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, mode
- Measures of Dispersion: Range, variance, standard deviation
- Measures of Relative Position: Percentiles, z-scores
- Distribution Shape: Skewness, kurtosis
- Frequencies: Frequency tables, histograms, bar graphs

CHAPTER 13: INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
- Null Hypothesis Testing: Setting up null and alternative hypotheses, determining significance levels
- Basic Tests: t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, chi-square
- Additional Considerations: Effect sizes, confidence intervals, power analysis
- Open Science: Replication, pre-registration, data sharing
