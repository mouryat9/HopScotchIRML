DEFINITIONS AND KEY CONCEPTS
----------------------------------------
Worldview, paradigm, or paradigmatic positioning (definitions & main ones) 
-A Worldview is a basic set of beliefs that guide action (Guba, 1990, p. 17) 
-Creswell (2007) defines a worldview as a fundamental set of beliefs or assumptions that guide how a researcher approaches and conducts their inquiry. These beliefs shape the researcher's understanding of the world, influencing their research design, data collection methods, and interpretation of findings. 
-Positivist worldview: A paradigm that views knowledge as objective and measurable, emphasizing empirical observation, quantifiable data, and the scientific method to uncover universal laws. 
-Post-Positivist worldview: An evolution of positivism that recognizes the limitations of absolute objectivity. It values empirical inquiry but acknowledges that all observations are theory-laden and subject to potential bias. 
-Constructivist worldview: A worldview that sees knowledge as socially constructed and subjective. It emphasizes understanding individuals’ experiences and meanings through qualitative methods and contextual interpretation 
-Pragmatic worldview: A practical and flexible paradigm that focuses on research questions and real-world outcomes, often combining qualitative and quantitative methods to find workable solutions. 
-Transformative worldview: A paradigm rooted in social justice and advocacy. It aims to challenge inequality and empower marginalized groups, often using participatory and critical research approaches.

SCRAPED WEB CONTENT: Researcher Worldview and Paradigmatic Positioning

From AP Research Library (Kennesaw State University):
Step 1 focuses on understanding who you are as a researcher through paradigmatic positioning. 
A paradigm or worldview is a basic set of beliefs that guide action (Guba, 1990).
The five main worldviews in research are:
- Positivism: Views knowledge as objective and measurable, emphasizing empirical observation and the scientific method
- Post-Positivism: Recognizes limitations of absolute objectivity, values empirical inquiry but acknowledges theory-laden observations
- Constructivism: Sees knowledge as socially constructed, emphasizes understanding individual experiences through qualitative methods
- Pragmatism: Focuses on research questions and real-world outcomes, often combining qualitative and quantitative methods
- Transformative: Rooted in social justice, aims to challenge inequality and empower marginalized groups
