DEFINITIONS AND KEY CONCEPTS
----------------------------------------
Research Question: 

The question that the study or research project aims to answer (Bouchrika, 2025). 
Addresses a specific issue or problem that can be answered in the study’s conclusion (Bouchrika, 2025). 
Outlines various aspects of the study, including the population, variables to be studied, and the problem the study addresses (Bouchrika, 2025). 
Comes from a gap in the research or conflicting research results in literature (Creswell, 2014). 
States the specific issue or problem that the study or research project will focus on (Monash University, 2025) 
The question around which the study or research project is centered around (George Mason University Writing Center, 2024) 


Hypothesis:

Predictions about what the results of the study or research project will show and is usually about the relationship between the variables (Creswell, 2014). 
Developed by reviewing existing evidence and then inferring what could happen within the specific context of the study or research project (Price et al., 2018) 
Can be tested through empirical investigation 
Two different types of hypotheses include alternative and null hypothesis (Creswell, 2014). 
Alternative hypotheses specify the results or relationships that are expected between the variables. 
Null hypotheses indicate no expected difference or no relationship between the variables. 

Issue: 
A research issue in qualitative research refers to the broad area of concern, tension, or interest that prompts inquiry. It is the starting point—a real-world problem, social phenomenon, or area of ambiguity—that the researcher wants to explore in depth. Unlike a tightly defined problem in quantitative research, a qualitative research issue is often open-ended, complex, and interpretive. It reflects something worth understanding rather than solving or measuring. "


Qualitative research question: 

Linked to the research design/tradition while being adaptable, non-directional, and more flexible than quantitative research questions (Creswell, 2014). 
Two different forms of qualitative research questions are central question and associated subquestions (Creswell, 2014). 
Central research question is broad and focuses on exploring the central phenomenon or concept in the study. 
Subquestions assists in narrowing the focus of the study while leaving it open for varied perspectives or meanings. 
Begins with words such as how or what and use exploratory verbs, such as explore, understand, or discover. 


Quantitative research question: 
Inquire about the relationships between variables that the research study is investigating (Creswell, 2014). 
Develops a link between the research question and the research design (Bouchrika, 2025). 
Usually categorized into three different types: descriptive, comparative, and relationship (Bouchrika, 2025). 
Descriptive research questions try to measure the responses of the research study’s population to one or more variables or describe the variables the research will measure. 

Typically begins with what. 

Comparative research questions try to discover the differences between two or more groups for an outcome variable. Example: Comparing a group who received the treatment vs. another group that did not. 
Relationship research questions try to explore and define trends and interactions between two or more variables. 
Typically use words such as association or trends as the question includes both independent and dependent variables. 


Mixed methods research question:
Directly addresses the mixing of the quantitative and qualitative strands of the research (Creswell, 2014). 
Known as hybrid or integrated question (Tashakkori & Creswell, 2007). 
Emphasize the methods or the content of the study or both (Creswell, 2014).

Consensus could be used to identify research questions that have been used in previously published studies. Consensus is an AI-powered search engine designed to take in research questions, find relevant insights within research papers, and synthesize the results using large language models. It is not a chatbot. Consensus only searches through peer-reviewed scientific research articles to find the most credible insights to your queries.: https://consensus.app/search/

SCRAPED WEB CONTENT: Research Questions

From Psychology Research Methods (Portland State University):
Chapter 2 covers the Scientific Method including research topic selection, question generation, hypothesis development, study design, data analysis, and result reporting.
Research questions drive the entire research process. A well-formulated research question should be:
- Specific and focused
- Researchable with available methods
- Relevant to the field of study
- Feasible within time and resource constraints
